300599,2023.0,False,Great bootcamp if you want to change career!,"<p>My goal was to change career from Sales to Product. This UX/UI course gave me the tools to establish this. The bootcamp&#39;s pre-work prepares you for the course, so you can get started with basic knowledge and skills. The course has a hands-on approach with the focus on working in project groups. This results in 5 portfolio projects. The teaching staff is experienced and always there to help. I learned a lot from them as well as other students. Although, I attended the course remotely, it felt like we were part of a family. Ironhack has a huge network within the industry. They have been able to assign me to exciting projects with companies that offered me to stay on after the bootcamp.</p>",4/25/2023,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

300057,2022.0,False,"Good classes, really bad ""career service""","<p>The classes were phenomenal, in my case my professor was outstanding, very patient and always glad to help anyone who needed it. As for the 2 TAs, one was better than the other, but they both still tried their hardest to help you in anything they want. So in the case of learning how to program (I did the web development bootcamp) it really was a nice experience where you learn a lot. Here comes my issues, the career service. They promised in their old website a really high chance to get a job after finishing their bootcamps (+90% of students found a job in less than 6 months supposedly), and they claim to have contacts with over 600+ companies, which does not really seem to be the case. The career service is only valid in my opinion so you can learn how to set up your LinkedIn, the rest of the stuff they organize/offer, is really not up to any kind of standards that you would expect, specially when they sell themselves in such a nice way, and for the cost, Id rather pay 50% just to go to class, and just skip the career service. They start bombarding you with e-mails, asking for job updates and what are you doing, and in my case, even after answering all of them, since I needed to find another job to sustain myself. I can not part-take in any of the events they organize even remotely in 99% of the cases, and seems like if you do not part-take in this kinda sect you are not welcome. So, finishing up, I would recommend that you go to another bootcamp if you just want to learn and want to avoid being sold smoke.</p>",4/8/2023,Web Development Bootcamp,2.0,[],1.0,4.0,1.0,ironhack

299046,2023.0,False,I regretted not having asked former students and having informed myself sufficiently,"<p>For absolute beginners, this course may be satisfactory as it provides a feel-good factor, but keep in mind that the industry standards are not taught in depth. While you may be able to secure a job after this training, this is also true for any other training program. Ultimately, your skills and portfolio will be what counts, not where you obtained your certificate. One of the highlights of the course is the group projects, where you collaborate on design thinking and user-centred design approach. You learn how to do Prototypes in Figma However, the course content and material provided in the student portal and lessons are quite introductory and can be found through a quick Google search. While design critique and feedback from fellow students may be helpful, it may not be as useful as feedback from qualified industry experts who have been in the industry for years. Some individuals may think that because they can take this course through the job center in Germany, there is not much to lose. However, I recommend doing thorough research on the course and its teachers and their career + portfolios, as well as looking at case studies and end results from former students on platforms like Medium. Compare the course with other excellent alternatives available in 2023 to make an informed decision. Reach out to former students, especially those who are currently employed as UI and UX designers on LinkedIn for their valuable insights. Lastly, it is not entirely accurate to say that this course is for advanced students or that it will prepare you to start your own business. The course does not have the resources for ,,advanced questions,, or the necessary personnel to provide advice to students who wish to start their own businesses. The companies suggested by the Career team may be more suited to individuals who prefer to work in an ,,old,, office setting.</p>",3/13/2023,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,1.7,[],2.0,2.0,1.0,ironhack
298679,2023.0,True,"Supply Chain Manager, in process to make a career switch to Data universe","<p>I highly recommend IRONHACK, in my case when I took the Data Analyst course the classes were highly dynamic. There are plenty options to fit in your agenda (onsite or remote, full-time or part-time). All the sessions are recorded in case of absence, or for future revisions and there are always a lead teacher and 2 assistants present. The human aspect is also considered during the course, making group activities and projects to increase empathy and synergy.

297578,2023.0,False,Waste of money and time. Disappointing.,"<p>The full content of the bootcamp consists of you reading and doing quizzes/labs alone. Then meeting with the class and facilitator and reviewing the tasks. There&rsquo;s no teacher or classroom by itself. You are supposed to learn everything with the content they give you, but the content sometimes is not complete or antiquated (so you will have to use google a lot). You are able to retake exams, the final exams were &ldquo;open book&rdquo; (so you can use all the modules to check for the correct answers) and sometimes the exams asked questions not mentioned in the theory. I feel that my grade has no value since everyone graduated (copying). If they were real exams, I think more than 1/2 of my cohort would have failed. We wasted a lot of time doing icebreakers, group challenges and nonsense presentations.(Icebreaker=talking about your favorite animal/color/movie&hellip;) Some of the group presentations, were incomprehensible since some of my classmates didn&rsquo;t speak english good enough. Working with them was really frustrating. I was told you had to have a minimum level of english and intellectual capacity to be able to join, but after experiencing the bootcamp, I can say they get in anyone with the money. I thought Ironhack was the best place to change your career, but now I realized is only one more bootcamp trying to get your money. I don&rsquo;t recommend you to take the Ironhack Cybersecurity Bootcamp. Pay for an academy to learn the foundations and then take the CompTIA Sec+ certification. (The bootcamp only covers 60% of the content of this certificate) It was a complete waste of money and time. I was scammed.

Even individual projects felt like collaborative projects because everyone helped each other out! I will say the Lead Teacher, especially by the end of the course, seemed quite tiered and not as eager to help us out as in the beginning. But the Teacher Assistant was there giving great back-up, which was ok. The campus environment is great as well, with all the different courses mixed together and with cool themed happy-hours every Friday 😎. The Bootcamp is very intense, as a Bootcamp should be, and it will test your limits for sure. Both mentally and physically (🥵). But it&rsquo;s by testing the limits that you learn what you are truly capable of doing and it unites you to your classmates in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible otherwise. By the end you&rsquo;ll be surprised by all you and your classmates have accomplished in just 2 months, it&rsquo;s crazy! For me the highlight was by far the people that did the bootcamp with me. They really become family, and that&rsquo;s worth more than 6000&euro; if you ask me 😜. But besides great friends, Ironhack also offers good career advice and support. The curriculum is pretty good (even though I wish more UI content was taught, as well as more about figma), but for me what stands out the most from the school is the career services they offer. A good curriculum you can find on online courses nowadays, but not career preparation and support. They give great insights on recruitment expectations and help you prepare for your career kick-off. I was lucky to find a job soon after the bootcamp but on average it takes 1-2 months after the course to get a job (depending on how soon you finish your portfolio). This course will not teach you everything you need to know, but it will teach you more than enough to start a Junior career in the field and give you the tools to continue learning on your own after it.</p>",12/15/2022,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,ironhack

The teacher, teaching assistants and my classmates became my family for 9 weeks and helped me through the process. Only one month after finishing I already found a Web developer position where to keep learning and improving, I absolutely recommend it either if you want to improve your skills or just change career as I did. They also offer support after the Bootcamp to help you find your desired job, which was a great help as you are always advised by professionals. It is very challenging but soon you realise how much you are capable of in a very short amount of time, even if you start with 0 previous experience like me you will end up with 3 great projects on your portfolio and all the knowledge necessary for your new path.</p>",11/30/2022,Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

I&#39;ve been trying to take this course for more than two years, but pandemic made it hard for me to do so. Now, I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already over. Oh, the lessons I&#39;ve learned. My most valuable lesson is how to work and coexist with people from such different backgrounds, cultures, ages and interests. I&#39;d consider I was lucky enough to befriend most of my classmates, who some I see as potential future work partners. The day-to-day is intense. They tell us about it, but once you&#39;re in there you get it. Many emotions are shared between people. I&#39;d say the whole array of emotions, but that&#39;s what makes us form deep connections with people and to ourselves as well. About the content, I&#39;d say is okay. Without having classmates, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be difficult to really get the most out of this bootcamp, truly. There are a lot of areas of opportunity, like a lot, but at least I know that, hopefully, for the next bootcamps it&#39;ll be better, as it probably was better for us compared to some early cohorts. All in all, I feel grateful for everything. This experience has changed my life, and I recommend it to anyone who needs a shift in their life. Many people I&#39;ve spoken to don&#39;t have the same opinion, so it&#39;s really up to the interpretation of each one. I&#39;ll really miss these times that I had, I truly will. But I&#39;m happy I was able to be a part of it. I&#39;m happy it happened. I&#39;m happy I was able to be a Hackshow winner, not without the help from my wonderful team, and support from colleagues and teachers.

The labs were usually great exercises for applying what we had learned that morning and extending the lesson further. During the third week of each module, we worked on projects which were to be presented on the Friday. For me, this was the most fun part of the course. It was amazing to be able to work on my own projects and have excellent teachers guide me through whenever I was blocked on a certain problem. Both Robin and Florian where great lead teachers. All of the staff, both teaching and operations, were fantastic throughout my time there. The facilities are as good as they get and there&#39;s tons of places to eat nearby. There were beers every Friday which was a great way to socialise with my classmates, the staff, and students from other courses. If you&#39;re thinking of enrolling, you absolutely should.

We were a class of 20 people but we had 1 leading teacher and 2 teacher assistants, so we had no problem at all while solving doubts or needing extra help with any exercise.

291924,2022.0,False,A huge career booster - I learned essential skills for working in the digital industry,"<p>I&#39;ll have to say in short: This was the toughest program I have ever gone through, it was very much a bootcamp, just like the name says. Absolutely energy draining and very stressful, but you really get what you put in: A huge advantage in the digital job market. Never learned so many important key concepts and technologies before in my life in such a short timespan. I already had a job in the digital industry and quite some experience, but lacked the ability to code and understand code myself. The bootcamp curriculum and student material is top notch, you get plenty of opportunities to practice and put literally everything you learn to the test with very helpful support on demand from the teachers and assistant teachers. JavaScript is absolutely key and the prowess you gain is immense. Never at any point did something I learn feel like: &quot;Yeah, we just do it because it&#39;s in the curriculum.&quot; - Everything was relevant for the job and really all modules complemented each other perfectly. However, I must say that the lectures and live codealongs were very energy draining due to the length (like 6-7 hours at a time) and the homework just put alot of extra workload on the students&#39; backs. My eyes really hurt from the long screentime, although I&#39;m super used to work computer jobs. Getting blocked after the teacher&#39;s working hours can be very frustrating, when nobody&#39;s really there to help and you need to finish mandatory homework. I expected something like a 40-45 hr week, but ended up getting more like a 60-hour-work-week (including weekends). For fast students it will feel like you are being slowed down by less advanced students, often there is no way to learn the lesson for the day self-paced/self-guided, though you could sometimes get permission to do that. The teacher&#39;s assistants are alumni, and if you are their first cohort, you will sometimes know that it&#39;s first time, when troubleshooting doesn&#39;t go that smoothly. If you are unlucky, it can sometimes not feel like the most professional experience. Otherwise, the organization is well run, the managers and lead teachers are super open to feedback and adapt quickly, everyone was always super friendly, polite and patient. For anyone who is willing to sacrifice a lot of energy, some health and social life for 3 months to go from zero to hero &ndash; DO IT. The experience was extremely rewarding, but also comes at a price. You can definitely change careers with this bootcamp, and if you want to upskill to reach new heights in your current digital job, this is the way to go!</p>",8/17/2022,Web Development Bootcamp,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

The lab will start from data cleaning to making a model by the end of the week. If you are truly dedicated to a career change, you will have to spend most evenings and nights working on labs. But as you keep repeating the same concepts over the 9 weeks along with learning additional methods to treat data you will get better. You do the labs in groups and its a very supportive environment. The pro&#39;s are you get to cover a variety of topics in data analytics and they are advanced topics so I would say its also more data science. The cons are its only 9 weeks so the schedule is very tightly packed and sometimes lectures are long so you will have to do labs in the evening after the lecture.

The whole bootcamp is a blatant lie. There isn&#39;t any really education, whatever is being taught is purely a marketing gimmick to show that 9 weeks is all it takes to change careers. The 9 weeks are just to get started with the basics. There are bootcamps that teach for over 20-30 weeks with the same price but the knowledge gained it far better. Do not fall into the trap that people land jobs after Ironhack like I said. Those that get a job all had some previous coding experience or the company was just a small one. The career hack was full of so many promises but lacked a lot. The career coaches have no clue on how a tech interview takes place nor have they ever applied to any tech job. My 2 cents from the entire experience would be save your money and do some Udemy courses. They are same. Ironhack boasts about it&#39;s network, but you&#39;re free to go for their meetup and events, or better go for in general tech events in your city.

We had a teacher that was a past student itself, with less than a year of industry experience and the paying the price of 7500 Euros to learn from a past student wasn&#39;t worth it. The course seems deliberate and squeezed in 9 weeks for marketing purposes. I&#39;d suggest choosing another provider over this one.

We were supposed to interview with local companies and that never happened. Overall it was not worth the 10k.

I was trying to change careers leaving a well-paying job. I could only ever recommend this Bootcamp if you&#39;re just graduating High School and have no plans to ever go to College. Definitely do not expect any actual job opportunities or assistance after the program they will just recommend you to go to job fairs. Out of 10 people in my class, only 2 landed jobs that were on their own. One had connections from before the course and the other already had a Degree in Engineering... the rest went back to previous employment outside of Tech.

This bootcamp represents a meaningful period of my life, where I have learned a lot (professionally and personally) and also tested my own limits, outside my comfort zone. Pros: &bull; The bootcamp structure allows you to retrain in a couple of months. &bull; The quality and quantity of the learning resources (courses, etc.) is great. &bull; In Paris (the only Ironhack campus I know), the teaching team is incredible, kind and understanding. &bull; You work on projects, bridging the gap between theory and practice. &bull; You are in a student environment (even though the final project is for a real client), and that allows you to fail and learn. Your fellow students will be one of your strengths. Cons: &bull; The bootcamp is intensive, the pace is steady and fast, you need to know that (and to know yourself) before jumping into such a course. It is much better to have a stable and supportive personal environment when you start a bootcamp like this one. Be prepared, and manage your energy &amp; time, it&#39;s a both a marathon and a sprint. &bull; There&#39;s a lot to learn in a small amount of time, you have to love learning (and to be able to stay attentive in a classroom environment). &bull; If you struggle with digital tools and concepts, you will be hindered by this. So, all in all, a great experience, not for everyone of course, but that can prove useful to kickstart a new career in UX/UI Design.

However, you get used to it. I definitely don&#39;t regret that I have chosen the full-time experience to fully immerse myself into the topic. Having no design background at all (In contrast to some other students of the cohort) I was struggling a bit with the user interface design part on Figma. For me the pace in the class was just too speedy and I had to catch up and practice a lot on the weekends. So be prepared tow rok evenings and weekends to keep up with the weekly deadlines. It is great that Ironhack offers such a course remotely. We were a small group of 11 people only, which I liked. There are some other cohorts with 21 people too... I was lucky enough to get this bootcamp paid by my employer. However, I am not so sure if I would have attended it if I would have had to pay the entire amount from my own pocket. For the career services I haven&#39;t herad so much promissing things, but i haven&#39;t attended it yet. But as always, you - yourself - are in control and take responsibilty of finding your job.

286102,2022.0,False,It was fast and furious! And very insightful,"<p>Recently I became a proud Ironhack Alumni! I did the UX/UI Design Bootcamp in Paris (remote). I come from a business background where I learned many of the tools we used during the Bootcamp but applied in different contexts. I want to share with you some of the main insights after having lived this experience. PROS &bull; The Ironhack crew is incredible, everyone is kind and understanding, and always open to help. &bull; They emphasize the importance of mental health during the Bootcamp, I really appreciated that. &bull; You have a lot of documentation for all of the different topics touched during the Bootcamp. &bull; Careerhack guidelines and tools are on top. CONS &bull; The pace is fast! Keep in mind that it will feel like jumping from one thing to the next, but at some point everything will connect, trust me. &bull; The format is not adapted to different types of learning. The motto is &quot;learn by doing&quot;, which is great! But if you are a person who learns differently, it might be a little hard for you to grasp the info, since it can be a lot to take in. &bull; If it is your first time interacting with subjects like Design Thinking, Lean, etc... It can be a little overwhelming. &bull; If you have never used any design software (like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.), you may take a little longer to understand with Figma. I suggest practicing and discovering the software on your own before the Bootcamp. SUGGESTIONS &bull; Organize your days. Do you consider yourself an unorganized person? Find a method that works for you, otherwise, you&#39;ll find yourself overwhelmed with many To-Dos. &bull; Take time for yourself. Find time to do those things that recharge your energy because, as I just mentioned in the previous point, you can easily find yourself feeling overwhelmed. &bull; If you have time before the Bootcamp, use it! Go through all the Careerhack tasks, this will make your life easier later. Also, I would definitely contact Alumni to learn about CVs, LinkedIn, Portfolios, or even ask about topics and tools that you don&#39;t know or would like to know better. If you do all these things in advance, you&#39;ll save a lot of time and feel less overwhelmed. You will learn many things (I hope) and have the opportunity to connect with amazing people with completely different backgrounds and personalities. Find and use methods that work for you, ask for help if needed, keep in mind that communication and empathy will be very important, and enjoy the ride because even though it feels like it will never end, it will. So to conclude, personally this Bootcamp meant a lot to me, academically, professionally, and personally. It helped me get back on track, I learned a lot even though I already knew the tools we were using, and I met incredible people!

However, there are some ways to improve the experience : - In fact, I would have prefer the lead teacher not to be remote (even if he was very available) - Only 1 teacher assistant for 12 persons was not enough as the lead teacher is not present during the afternoon labs (and I understood that there is normally 1 TA for 10 persons) - People can choose their projects team and I don&#39;t think it is the best option because you can easily find yourself in a group with a very low level and as nobody is really able to lead it, it&#39;s frustrating and you have to ask help from the teacher all the time. It also generates tension between people of the group.

Les ressources mises &agrave; disposition avant le d&eacute;but du bootcamp (le pre-work) permettent &agrave; tous les &eacute;tudiants de d&eacute;buter avec les m&ecirc;mes bases (html, CSS et notions de JavaScript). Cette premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape n&#39;est pas &agrave; prendre &agrave; la l&eacute;g&egrave;re, car elle permet de s&#39;habituer &agrave; son rythme aux nouveaux languages qui seront &eacute;tudi&eacute;s pendant le cursus (compter une soixantaine d&#39;heures pour tout r&eacute;aliser). Le programme est tr&egrave;s ax&eacute; sur le JavaScript, ce qui permet de d&eacute;velopper la logique n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la programmation. Il est important (voir indispensable) de lire les cours du lendemain, afin de se familiariser avec les nouvelles notions quotidiennes. C&#39;est un travail suppl&eacute;mentaire certes, mais c&#39;est une &eacute;tape importante pour ne pas d&eacute;crocher pendant le bootcamp ! Le rythme &eacute;tant vraiment tr&egrave;s soutenu, un moment d&#39;inattention peut faire perdre beaucoup de temps ensuite, pour revoir la notion qui a &eacute;t&eacute; laiss&eacute;e de c&ocirc;t&eacute;. Il est important de se rendre compte que, pendant ces deux mois, on parcourt &eacute;norm&eacute;ment de notions diff&eacute;rentes, de concepts nouveaux et de logiques auxquelles nous ne sommes pas forc&eacute;ment habitu&eacute;s. C&#39;est tr&egrave;s dense, et pourtant, ce n&#39;est que la partie &eacute;merg&eacute;e de l&#39;iceberg !

283876,2021.0,False,Intense but enriching!,"<p>As the bootcamp is divided into different phases, I&#39;m going to divide my feedback for each one: 1. The pre-work The pre-work needs to be done on Ironhack&#39;s platform. The courses are very clear and the exercises manageable on our own. It was intense to start with, but very important to complete it as it helps a lot to get prepared for the bootcamp. I recommend to take more time than advised if you don&#39;t want to do it in a rush. 2. The courses: The courses are well constructed and understandable. All of the teaching staff is very professional, understanding and responding to all our questions which is great as we all come from different backgrounds and therefore do not have the same approach to design. We learn theory and practice it through different projects in parallel which is nice to really get into the work and also learn to work on projects with different people. We work on the whole Design Thinking process which gives us the opportunity to practice both UX and UI and get a good knowledge at the end of the bootcamp. 3. Careehack: The career week was interesting and we had some good advice for our job research, though very general. It is sad we did not work more practical exercises related to UX/UI Design that we can have during job interviews. I also regret the fact that the tool we are given to improve our CVs is not adapted to French CVs and the platform content is not up to date. 4. Hybrid campus: We had the opportunity to follow the courses both on the campus (which is very nice) and in remote. I really enjoyed having these 2 options which were both well organized. If I had to give recommendations to anyone who want to start this bootcamp it would be: - Be ready to work a lot (but keep in mind it is just for 2 months and then you&#39;ll get great new skills), - Be open-minded and adaptable, - Get ready to manage changing emotions (yours and others), - Take some time for yourself, - Don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions. Overall, I had a very good experience at Ironhack Paris, very intense for sure (but that is what I expected as it is a bootcamp), but enriching in terms of learning, practicing and also on a human side.</p>",12/3/2021,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,3.7,[],4.0,4.0,3.0,ironhack

281886,2021.0,False,A big head start if you want to transition into web development,"<p>The Ironhack web development was a really nice experience. The classes were online, with the teacher being remote, although some of the students gathered at the school location. But the fact that it was online did not hinder the learning experience in any way, the teacher and TA were still able to help us efficiently through Zoom. The curriculum tries to be as practical as possible, to better equip for the job market. So it doesn&#39;t really give in-depth explanations on computer science, or how the language (in my case JavaScript) actually works, etc... We learned the really basic things we need to know in order to not feel lost when we learn more by ourselves. The program is very practical : when we learned something in the morning, we directly applied it during the lab in the afternoon which helped me learn better. The labs were self-guided and had a lot of instructions, so doing the labs by myself often helped me understand the concepts studied in class better than when the teacher explained it. Doing a 2-months bootcamp doesn&#39;t make a solid developer (it&#39;s only 2 months) but it gives you enough basics that you can learn by yourself after and quickly become a solid junior developer. At the end of the bootcamp, the teacher told us that the only way to become a good developer is just continuous practice and learning. You have to be willing to go and learn above the bootcamp&#39;s basic curriculum if you want a good position fast. Ironhack helps us a lot to get jobs after the bootcamp, which is a major positive note. As someone who was not really knowledgeable on how to get jobs, network, prepare for interviews, especially technical interviews, Ironhack&#39;s Careerhack program really helped me. The main obvious con is the price. I had the opportunity to have the Vinted Scholarship and got a financial help from the Ile-de-France region, but if you have to pay full price, it&#39;s a budget to keep in consideration. However, if you really want to transition to web development, Ironhack&#39;s bootcamp is a good investment in order to transition fast, especially since the course is certified by the State (in France at least).</p>",9/29/2021,Web Development Bootcamp,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack

Our teacher&#39;s learning methodology was superb and the projects we developed, are an excellent springboard for a career as a developer. Some useful tips for future students are: - Take time for your labs. Don&#39;t focus too much on completing them, but understanding what is going on and being playful with them, while trying to find different solutions. - SAVE EVERYTHING. Literally. Organise your bookmarks in folders, modules, topics, etc. and save them all. This will be incredibly helpful after the Bootcamp and even during it. Also, save the links to the lab solutions. This will be become relevant, when you start learning Hooks on ReactJS. - Take Screenshots. You will be thankful for saving some of the &#39;&#39;Mona Lisas&#39;&#39; (:D) of your teachers, specially after a long day of lessons. - Slack. Again, save everything useful. Extremely useful things will be shared there and the messages get automatically deleted after a certain amount of time. Technologies, e-books, websites, libraries, extra lessons, solutions and many, many memes. We actually got a PDF from one of our teachers, with the links and helpers for the whole Bootcamp afterwards.

The stakes are higher for an adult (more sacrifices, family, job, going back to school etc) Other than that , I think it&#39;s a good and complete training !</p>",9/16/2021,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,3.7,[],3.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack

The content of the course was fine the only thing which I find is a shame is that there wasn&#39;t any link with the prework.

281385,2021.0,False,Personal opinion about Ironhack Data Analytics Remote Bootcamp,"<p>Dear Leadies and Gentelmen, I will share with you my terrible experience with Ironhack hoping that it will be useful to you and that you will not make the mistake I made. I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones, even ignoring them thinking that these were just exceptions, people who did not want to learn something new. But now I know they were people telling the truth. I don&#39;t want to offend anyone, I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it. So let&#39;s begin! 1. The Teacher &ndash; Ignacio Soretas He can&#39;t speak English properly! He has a hard time understanding what we said, of course, I understand that English is not his mother language, but this is not just about pronunciation, it&rsquo;s about the word combination he uses. He just lacks the ability to explain, to express himself correctly. Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It&rsquo;s very important to clean your data. OR I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let&#39;s imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that&#39;s why I chose this example. Here&#39;s how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It&rsquo;s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we&rsquo;re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn&#39;t teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn&#39;t teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like &lsquo;Who is the strongest Pokemon?&rsquo;. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week&hellip; but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don&rsquo;t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can&rsquo;t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that&rsquo;s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! Go to Udemy, Coursera, etc&hellip; and remember Data Analytics isn&rsquo;t a sprint it&rsquo;s a lifelong journey!</p>",9/12/2021,Data Analytics Bootcamp,1.0,[],1.0,1.0,1.0,ironhack

But the bootcamp overall was a good experience, I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad, sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience, as for the bootcamp gained knowledge, I feel there is room for improvement but doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad, it&rsquo;s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest, the staff are super super friendly, man I can&rsquo;t emphasise how good and amazing they were, as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students, my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life, the campus man, I want to live there, top tbh top, that&rsquo;s all pros I guess, I&rsquo;ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge, anyone with previous knowledge, throw that aside and learn from the start then connect, you&rsquo;ll never learn enough with a half filled cup, empty the cup, learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge. As for me tbh, I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn. Another thing is the hybrid mode, I personally loved it, if it&rsquo;s any problem to you, you can attend there and do online together but if you&rsquo;re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers. As for the bootcamp all in all, I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially, this will be good for you, plus you&rsquo;ll be certified. My only problem tbh, might not be my only one, it is while I&rsquo;m writing this because just top of my mind, I know it&rsquo;s long sorry hehe, the money, kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to apply them together, some people paid more, some paid less, some didn&rsquo;t pay at all they got full scholarships, which felt weird to be honest, but alas we were there to learn so doesn&rsquo;t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now, at least that&rsquo;s my judgment, I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but my opinion haa.

275755,2020.0,False,Worth the time and effort!,"<p>Going into the Ironhack experience I had minimal Web Development experience, but this bootcamp gave me more of a well rounded knowledge about programming and the right programming practices than I could have ever imagined. I&#39;d definitely say that the most valuable skills I gained from this bootcamp was how important it is in this industry to plan and pseudo code, and definitely working with others on various projects. I couldn&#39;t be more grateful for the help I got from my instructors, Marcos (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-palacios-iii/), Sandra (https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-boskovic/), and Stefan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cule219/). If I ever was falling behind or felt like I wasn&#39;t getting it they were always willing to take the extra time to help me understand what was going on and the best way to approach the problem. After getting through the bootcamp came the fun part of job hunting and it was an extremely painless process thanks to being shown how to job hunt correctly, and I owe that to my outcomes manager Brito (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbrito1/). He was extremely thorough and provided me with tons of resources to make the job finding process easy and simple. I know I couldn&#39;t have gotten the job I have today if it weren&#39;t for Brito and his help/connections. He always held me accountable and that&#39;s the most important part of the whole process as an up and coming Developer. Overall Ironhack was the best decision of my life, I went from someone who was working in the food industry and coding as a hobby to working a full time job as a Developer for a great company and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.</p>",4/12/2021,Web Development Part-Time,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
275751,2021.0,False,Worth the effort!,"<p>Here are my impressions a few days after completing the web development bootcamp at Ironhack in Paris: Before the bootcamp started I had to complete a pre-work course which is a series of online lessons and exercises to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. 100+ hours of work later, I had already learned so much that I was under the impression that the bootcamp was going to be a walk in the park. I couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong! Although the pre-work seemed a lot, I had only started to scratch the surface of what is needed to become a full stack developer. The bootcamp is only 9 weeks long but it felt more like 9 months because if you want to follow the pace you have to dedicate all your time and energy to it (nights and weekends included!). The structure of the bootcamp is as follows: every morning you learn new concepts and skills, every afternoon you do a guided project - called &quot;lab&quot; - to put the lesson into practice. The labs are challenging and put you in real life work situations so it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to learn. There are sometimes solo labs, sometimes group labs so you can practice working on your own as well as with a team of developers. At the end of every 2 weeks, you have 1 week to develop a project of your own with a couple of teammates to test your skills and start building your portfolio. During the entire bootcamp you get the support of super skilled teachers. They always look for the right balance between helping you when you get stuck on a problem and letting you find the solution for yourself so that you do not only learn to blindly apply concepts but genuinely understand them. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Ironhack. Yes, it&rsquo;s been intense but I could not have learned this much in such a short time with another format. Thank you to all the Ironhack staff and to the students of the web dev cohort 102 for making this bootcamp so enjoyable!</p>",4/12/2021,Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

I&#39;ve enrolled in the UX UI Bootcamp at a time when I was a bit stuck in my career, shifting from Event Management to becoming a freelance webdesigner. Because I didn&#39;t have any proper knowledge of Design, I looked for courses and the more I discovered about the UX UI subject, the more I understood that I needed to learn skills in this field. However, I didn&#39;t want to go back to long studies (I have already done 6 years of university and didn&#39;t want to go back to square 1). I came across Ironhack&#39;s intensive bootcamp in UX UI Design and decided to enroll after attending a Zoom presentation. Pros: - intensive course that will give you all the tools and methodology to succeed in your future career - Projects carried out during the whole bootcamp to apply and practice your newly earned knowledge - Teaching team of quality who have professional experiences in the field - Fully English course (a real plus when you know that English is almost mandatory in the job world) - Learn by doing method - real coaching done for job hunting Cons: - that the course doesn&#39;t last longer in the end!

The teaching is great as they&#39;re very supportive but also really challenge you. The course is split into three modules: front-end, back-end and full-stack. Each of these have a project at the end where you have a chance to really show off your new skills and each of these were a chance for me to push myself and create something I was really proud of. It would have great to have done this course without the covid-restrictions but they way it has been modified to take these into account was very successful.

You will see the lesson/theory in the morning, and then practice all afternoon (and most likely all night as well haha!). There are teacher assistants to help you, and a nice balance of solo and group projects. I think one of the most important things these days would be the adaptation to covid-related issues. The bootcamp was flexible (possible to go to the campus, or to work remotely whenever you want), and this gave me the opportunity to save 3 hours+ of commute everyday, so I could focus on the labs and rest.

No matter what your entry level is, the mentors always were sure you were not left behind and were very patient and willing to explain it until the whole class understood. I felt always very safe to ask any questions, which is very important to me. Instead of the bootcamp on location, I attent the remote cohort. At Ironhack they really know how to organized remote classes. It was a good balance between classes, tasks and self learning. Even remote, every one was always involved in the classes throughout the day. And there was no room for slacking :) , which I also very much like. Make sure you do not plan anything at all these three months. It will be 100% bootcamp which I was grateful for afterwards. Besides learning, we also build up a bond within the class.

275311,2021.0,False,Ironhack Review,"<p>Many times in life, we have the pleasure of coming across an opportunity to change our lives completely. Less than a year ago, I had just arrived in Miami with only one certainty. Despite my interest in the field, I have neither the skills nor the knowledge to pursue a career in tech. Through the influence of my dearest friend, I build up the courage to start a UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Ironhack. In January of 2021, I began my journey in an intense boot camp, with the most creative and passionate students and teachers I had ever met. Suddenly, something that seemed impossible, started becoming true. I was understanding, practicing, and becoming well versed in the best design practices and tools. All of this was thanks to the incredible staff and program that the school offers. There are many forms of indoctrination, different practices, millions of schools, but Ironhack creates an environment of accelerated learning beyond comparison. In addition, the school offers impeccable support in career services. In my 9th week at the Ironhack, I was offered a job as a UX/UI Designer and was able to position myself, thanks to the support of Daniel Brito, my career coach. In a nutshell, Ironhack is the perfect place for everyone and anyone, who desires to start a career in tech. I had an amazing experience and in short, time have already started seeing the benefits of my time invested in the course.

275285,2021.0,False,The best decision of my life despite having 10+ years of prior programming experience. Career services rock!,"<p>I graduated from Ironhack Miami&#39;s full-time web development bootcamp this March and I can&#39;t recommend it enough. I was very hesitant at first to join any sort of bootcamp. I looked into it a few years ago and compared them all. I weighed pros and cons and in the end always thought I could make it without the help of a bootcamp so I just waited and pretended that I would start the job search eventually but two years later I was still unemployed. I got an email from OfferUp announcing their partnership with Ironhack and it piqued my interest. I gave it a shot and won a partial scholarship which was enough to offset the interest fees from the loan. I was also able to get approved for the loan by one of their financing partners despite having a very poor credit score and high credit utilization which was a blessing! As the title of my review says, I had already been programming since I was a teenager. I&#39;ve worked on several multiplayer game mods and even created games, programs and websites of my own. Being self-taught is great! There was one big drawback however; I could not find a job. My resume was awful, I did not know how to network nor the true importance of networking. I had no clue how to sell myself or how to talk to recruiters. It was obvious to me that joining a bootcamp would not make me gain any significant technical skills considering my extensive background. I already had a fair understanding of the material being taught and could have brushed up those skills within a week or two. So why did I join Ironhack? Simply for the one and only Daniel Brito from Ironhack&#39;s Career services. Throughout the bootcamp, I was able to schedule one-on-one meetings with him in order to discuss my career goals as well as get advice on how to approach certain companies and very good interview preparation help. I always had so many questions prepared for him yet I only needed to ask him one question and he would predict my next 2-3 questions and answer them in advance. He really knows his stuff! As soon as Brito walked us through updating our LinkedIn profiles, I was assaulted by recruiters left and right and didn&#39;t know what to do. He pointed me in the right direction, told me what to watch out for and what to expect. He gave me the confidence that I needed to aim high and shoot for the positions I didn&#39;t see myself achieving for another 5 years. Thanks to his guidance, I landed a job two weeks before graduating as a DevOps engineer for an amazing company who works with what is in my opinion the best tech stack you can have in 2021. Compared to other bootcamps that say you don&#39;t pay until you get hired (or worse, the ones that take a percentage of your salary!) Ironhack was the only clear viable choice for me. I knew full well going into it that I was there for Brito first and foremost and to make great connections second. I&#39;ve created some relationships that I hope to carry with me for life not only with fellow students but with my teacher Niko as well. I can&#39;t say enough about the teacher I had. Honestly I have never seen a teacher so passionate when it comes to his student&#39;s success. Most teachers would traditionally stop and go MIA as soon as the clock turns over or your time in the bootcamp is up, but not at Ironhack. Niko and I actually started a passion project together which is aimed at helping students stay in touch and keep learning and connecting with others even post-graduation. I think that speaks for itself in the amount of care that goes into your learning experience. You&#39;ll never feel like you&#39;re just a number on a spreadsheet that needs to get a grade. If you are in the same situation I was four months ago meaning you are passionate about code, are self taught and have been struggling to enter the professional world or are simply afraid of the financial burden of having to take out a loan, take it from me. I went from earning 16k/year from self-employment income to now earning six figures doing the job I&#39;ve been dreaming about ever since I was a teenager. I&#39;ll be receiving my first paycheck two days from now and I still can&#39;t believe it. All it took was one small leap of faith and trusting reviews from another course review website to completely change my life not just in this moment but for the rest of it.</p>",3/30/2021,Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

274038,2020.0,False,IronHack Miami is the BEST!,"<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about Ironhack! One of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made in my life. I was a Graphic Designer for 10 years and decided to take the plunge at going back to school for UX/UI Design. Coming from a long design background, certain things were familiar to me but the things that weren&rsquo;t Ironhack did an excellent job at teaching. Their curriculum portal is accessible at any time, it has a combination of text, videos, images, and is filled with useful links and resources. They have an amazing teaching staff and administration. One of the things that really won me over about Ironhack was that almost every employee has completed an Ironhack bootcamp. They have been where you are and they show it! My two main teachers were great! But I feel like the real added touch was the combination of a teacher and teacher&rsquo;s assistant. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t enough time for one on ones with everyone and the teacher, and the assistant usually helps facilitate that. I have to give a huge shout out to my teacher&rsquo;s assistant for my course, Jade McVay. This part of my review is split because my case is unique. My course, halfway through the second part was during the COVID quarantine madness. Now everyone has implemented systems that work for remote and things have gotten smoother. But at the time in March there were a lot of uncertainties and questions. But without a doubt and missing a beat Ironhack answered the call and things continued rather smoothly in virtual. It left me very impressed! When it came to career services, I think it is by far Ironhack Miami&rsquo;s strongest asset. Their career coach Daniel Brito is the Godfather of Miami Tech! His determination to get you hired, get you going, motivated and more is unmatched. I&rsquo;ve never seen a school care so much about your well being POST graduation. In my case it took 6 months for me to get employed. COVID played a huge factor in my case. However, even with new graduating classes after mine, Brito did not give up on me! He made sure I had the tools I needed, the tips and tricks, and was the personal bridge to new network connections.

272383,2020.0,False,Check out the statistics before applying,"<p>I attended the full time UX/UI Design bootcamp at Ironhack last year. I come from a background unrelated to UX/UI Design, but wanted to make a career change. I considered different options, including studying at college, but felt like getting out there and start my career. Reading the very good reviews here at Switchup, I decided to go for Ironhack. Unfortunately, I was naive. Ironhack has a really supporting and helpful community, and the learning by doing methodology resulted in a few case studies that I could showcase in my portfolio after graduating. However, there are a few things I want an aspiring attendee to have in mind. First of all: - Ironhack advertises themselves as having a &#39;90% placement rate 180 days after graduation&#39;. This is very misleading. The placement rate is calculated by dividing the number of employed students / number of students looking for a job. What they don&#39;t mention is that: out of all the graduates, only 68% are job searching. And their definition of &#39;employed&#39; includes Hired-in-field, Hired-out-of-field (!), Ironhack Employee, Freelancer, Internships and Entrepreneurs. In reality, it&#39;s only 50% of UX/UI Design graduates who get a job within UX/UI Design after 6 months. I graduated several months ago and only a few people out of 20 in my cohort have managed to get a job at this point. Of course covid-19 complicates everything, but I have applied for 140+ jobs (resulting in around 10 interviews), studied theory and completed unpaid internships, and it seems quite hopeless at this point. I recommend reading their number in details here https://www.ironhack.com/en/news/ironhack-student-outcomes-report-audited-by-pwc - Another point that might be implicit when applying for a 10 week bootcamp is that the education is quite shallow. We never learned how to make safe assumptions out of research data. Instead, we angled the research to fit our design idea. This was due to lack of time and lack of knowledge since we never actually learned why we did things on a deeper level. We never got any feedback on our actual design process or design thinking, only on how we presented our design. I think this is a problem since we compete with people with more education and more experience within research and design thinking. - The education was very unstructured which became really stressful. We were already expected to put in 60-70 hours a week, but the teachers rarely managed to keep the time, resulting in a huge stress since we every week had to deliver a product design and a great presentation. ... I will keep applying for jobs and refining my profile, but I would recommend anyone who considers Ironhack to think it through and be a bit skeptical.</p>",1/18/2021,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,2.3,[],2.0,3.0,2.0,ironhack

Regarding their technical knowledge, sometimes I felt they lacked it when we asked questions in depth.

Some topics are briefly discussed but they require a lot more of self-study after the bootcamp as in between sessions we're too busy with the evening labs (which take hours to solve, trust me).
Keep in mind that in the full-time bootcamp, there's no day in between each class where you can see deeper some concepts. Every day is super challenging and we're moving onto new subjects quickly, so it's super important to keep your head out of the water and ask questions until you fully understand, otherwise you will miss a lot of knowledge.
The technologies studied are overall good for the current job market except for Mongo DB (non-relational DB) which I wouldn't recommend because it's a  and nowadays relational DB (like mySQL) are more in demand on job offers.
Regarding the career week, to me, it sounded like a joke. From their marketing campaigns, it looks like they'll arrange for you interviews with companies they have an agreement with (based on their ""algorithm""), but in fact in that week, you basically learn how to make a CV and a cover letter, and they keep repeating to you that you should use your network and that they won't help you if you don't do your part of the job and complete all the tedious tasks on the student portal.
One great thing was the ambiance with the other students and those from other cohorts. Especially during a very intense bootcamp where your brain is overwhelmed, it was nice, even remotely, to get to (virtually) meet up, play games, etc.
Overall I don't regret the experience of a coding bootcamp because I learned a lot and that gave me a great push for a career in development, but don't fool yourself, you need to work a lot more and for many more months before you get a job in development unless you have coding experience prior to the bootcamp.
A coding bootcamp is really not for everyone. If you're really determined to get a job right after, you better start working months before enrolling.
Also, considering the price, I really think it's a rip-off (unless you get a substantial scholarship). The price for the on-site bootcamp and the remote one are almost the same which is not justifiable as by learning remotely, you don't use any location from Ironhack, you use your own desk, electricity, internet, etc, and even for the events, you're bringing your own beer! 
Honestly, there are plenty of other schools that offer similar curriculums for a much lower price (especially for the remote course).

270471,2020.0,False,Exceeded my expectations and beyond!,"I could not be more impressed with my experience at Ironhack. Where do I start? 

When I discovered the UX field I knew that I would be a perfect fit, however, I also knew I needed proper guidance when making the career change. Ironhack provided me with more than enough guidance and resources to accomplish my goal of landing a job and making a complete career change. 

This program is called a 'bootcamp' for a reason. It is tough and intense. You are learning A LOT each day through lectures and (mostly) project work. However, the instructors are there for you at all times to answer any questions and offer you the proper guidance. The instructors I had were VERY knowledgable about the UX process and best practices, and they were always so patient with those who needed extra time to fully understand the concepts. I never felt intimidated or scared to approach them with any questions or concerns that I had. They created a very inspiring and encouraging classroom environment. Following the examples of our instructors, all of my fellow classmates were always willing to help each other out and pick each other up. By the end of the bootcamp, we had all gotten pretty close and it was honestly hard to say goodbye. 

Another part of the program I really benefitted from was their Career Services. Brito (the Ironhack Outcomes Manager) is an absolute job and networking guru! Something I really liked about this part was their honesty. They made it clear that if you want to land a job out of this program, then you need to be the one doing the networking and applying. So many bootcamps out there promise that they will hand you a job right out of the program, which is total BS. But Ironhack's approach is to teach you the best methods of networking, applying, interviewing, and setting up your LinkedIn. Rather than catching a fish for you, they teach you how to fish. 

I was able to land a really good Product Design job within a month of graduating. However, landing a job takes some people longer than others. I can honestly say that this program changed my life for the better. I was working in farms and restaurants prior to this, barely getting by on my hourly pay, and now I have landed a permanent role with a great salary and benefits. I am forever grateful for Ironhack and owe them so much. 

Last but not least I do want to say: this program isn't a walk in the park. It is a lot of work and very stressful at times, but this just means that you will be learning a lot of information.

It&rsquo;s now up to me to continue learning by myself as one does after graduating from any school or college. It was inspiring to work with other students in such an immersive training program. We helped each other, supported one another, and also had tons of fun on Zoom and Slack. I highly recommend Ironhack to anyone looking for a program to start learning UX design.

I have mixed feelings about it so I made 2 lists. Let&#39;s start with the cons (so I can finish on a positive note): - There is only 1 teacher. He&#39;s called lead teacher but he is the only one so &quot;lead&quot; here is irrelevant. I think it&#39;s a shame because there are so many ways to do design that learning just one approach is a bit short. - They make you buy a macbook for nothing. There are two 3 hour lessons on Sketch. Which is pretty much the only reason you&#39;d need a Mac. keep your money, work on a PC and borrow a MacBook for these lessons. You&#39;ll be fine. - Figma &amp; Sketch Labs are very very light. I really feel I still can&#39;t make the most of them. - The webdev week is laughable. The &quot;lead teacher&quot; was trying his best to teach us webdev basics. I was expecting a proper webdev teacher with structured and organized classes. I thought my 8000&euro; would buy that. I was naive. - The social aspect is cheap. They emphasize on the possibility to network and all the fabulous events that are organized... It doesn&#39;t exist. There are IronBeers on the rooftop once a week with one beer/person that they put in the fridge in advance so you can&#39;t really come unexpectedly. For the last one we had a few chips, 1 slice of ham per person and madeleines from Franprix with cheap wine. Just sad and cheap. Now let&#39;s talk about the pros: - the remote classes didn&#39;t feel so remote. They had some training with the first lockdown. It was pretty easy to follow even though we weren&#39;t on the campus. - The educational method is very efficient. You start working on projects from day one. You practice directly what you learn during class which makes it immediately very concrete and understandable. - At the end of the bootcamp, I felt ready to work. I had projects to show on my resume and I had some work worth a portfolio. And that is what counts!!!! - The career week and the coaching are both very good. I just finished so I can&#39;t tell more but from I&#39;ve seen so far, it&#39;s the first time I feel supported in my job search.

The premises of the Deskop coworking space are very pleasant and very suitable for bootcamps. The district has many restaurants of all kinds that offer take-out. In short: an ideal setting for our learning!

Regarding the lessons, the pace is very fast: it starts strong and it never stops. Fortunately, the teacher is available and always takes the time to answer questions (so do not hesitate to ask!). It is vital to be hyper motivated because the lack of time during the bootcamp implies a personal work downstream to go further.

Many projects are to be presented (perhaps too much, which is frustrating when you want to go further, but) this allows you to constantly put into practice the courses of the week, and especially to have concrete to present to recruiters as soon as we are looking for a job.

On the techno side, the courses are clearly focused on Python, but allow a good grip of Git, SQL and Tableau. The course materials are online and do not always match the content of the course itself. Sometimes that's good because it provides clarification, but you can't always find what has been said in class ... ""Google is our friend""!

Indeed, this training makes you confident enough to work for any early stage start-up and as a junior ux/ui designer even if you have no background in design.

They have managed to adapt smoothly to only-remote classes and even in this context I found it very easy to learn and work with the other students. The morning was dedicated to class and afternoon to labs. One needs to bear in mind that this is an intensive bootcamp hence the need to dedicate some time outside the class hours to go through the class material or review the classes of the day. It took a little bit of time for me to realize that and I went through some quite anxious phases when at some points I was realizing I was completely lost!
What I particularly liked was the fact that for my final project I was given the freedom to do it my way: I decided to follow a product management methodology to develop the app I was working on, meaning I spent a lot of time doing discovery before actually starting the development phase, and both the teacher and TA supported me on this initiative.",10/5/2020,Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,ironhack

 It was a great time spend with the Ironhack team and my fellow Ironhakers (and even more because our cohort had many women in it!).
I loved the group projects and the overall group dynamic, how the teacher and TA where there for us and really helped us and how for each module we had a time to make some feedback to improve our learning process (reviewing the practices that really worked for us, those that worked less, and make suggestions to improve our global experience).

The final week was dedicated for the final project.

The journey started long (dependent how you deal with deadlines/preparations) before the bootcamp with the introduction to git, python, sql and statistics. I highly recommend taking the time to absorb those information to form strong foundation for the upcoming challenge.

Along the way, the supportive Ironhack team would check in to ensure you that the emotional rollercoaster is completely normal, I recommend speaking up with the rest of your class to share the experience, soon you will learn that you are not alone.

The material covered are just deep enough to provide enough guidance for future work, let's be honest 8 weeks is a short time to cover everything. The most important is to deliver the mindset of questioning what is in front of you, and the toolkit and understanding to be able to do your own research faster.

The projects and the subsequent presentation of your work is a valuable experience, however I was expecting to have one of the project to be teamed up with a company to provide some career network/progression for after the bootcamp.

The other students were nice overall, i had nice people experience. I think the teachers are also ok.
The material is super outdated and very low level. They use materials from 2016-2017, some of them are not actual and many of the source materials are not available. Teachers upload missing data to google drive as they realize its missing, but we still use outdated stuff.

Learning portals(Udemy, Coursera etc) vs Ironhack

Learning material: 
Learning portals:  10/10, very up to date, and huge selection.
Ironhack: 3/10, outdated and the same for years without change. They don't even take effort to find out tasks, you have to do them.


Price:
Learning portals: 10/10 , from free, super cheap
Ironhack: 2/10, 7000$, can be much, much more at other bootcamp schools

Teacher knowledge:
Learning portals: 10/10, the greatest minds are sharing their knowledge.
Ironhack 3/10: They definately are not stupid. And they do their best I'm assuming. But its not compareable.

Hours included:
Learning portals: as much as you want
Ironhack: 400ish(half of them are 'standups' and 'games' which are not fun super useless and really do take a lot of time away).

Actual hours put in:
Learning portals: 2/10, usually people slack off because its free/cheap and there is no time limit.
Ironhack: 7/10, as above, you pay and you want to get something for your money so you slack less.

Paper for people with no PHD:
Learning portals: 3/10, if you can actually do what is in your 'certifications', the sky is the limit. But just the certificate itself doesn't worth shit.
Ironhack: 2/10, same as above, but since you can only learn less, you can't show up more.

Career support:
Learning portals: usually close to 0
Ironhack: I did not attend this, i was disappointed enough in the 10 weeks. I don't expect anything big, the only 'alumni' they could get to talk to us as previous student was a super lowlvl job(the guy was cool though so no offense there).

This could be said about all courses and bootcamps on the world, but from online courses you can get refunds super easily if you dont like something, so its easier to select out the trash. With bootcamps you pay thousands of dollars with no hope of a refund if its shit.

TLDR: Overall experience:
I'm not sure what I expected from this, I was new to the field and wanted to jump in somehow, just learning a few hours every now and then was not really effective. So in a way it was good, because I spent the time on learning, not on playing games etc. Also i did not have to work during the 10 week with full salary because of covid. So i only regret it halfsy.
Don't do any bootcamps if you can sit down by yourself to study/read stuff. The only reason to pick a bootcamp is because you can't get yourself to sit down and learn. If you can, online learning is the way.

It is perfect if you want to quickly kick-off your transition in that domain or ramp-up on those technologies. 
On the other hand, not being able to go really go deep on all topics to follow the courses flow was a bit frustrating. Bootcamp format gives you nice groundings to start your ramp-up, but keep in mind that a lot of work remain after to develop your expertise.

And I was very fortunate to have a great teacher with a lot of experience teaching remotely, making the remote-environment very enjoyable. I had high expectations coming in, but I can honestly say that Ironhack has surpassed them. One thing to keep in mind is that you will definitely not be done learning after Ironhack. Ironhack gives you all the tools and knowledge you need to get a very good start and possibly land a job as (Junior) Web Dev, but you will have to keep put in the effort and learn more yourself afterwards.

During my class, Corona Pandemic hit which forced us to move all the classes online. 
Cons:
- we had our teacher changed, as it was not meeting with the expectations of the course during the course, which made us lose classes and the part of UX Research for example for damaged as it was not the speciality of the teacher itself
- we are done since one month and a half and we haven't had any fast track interviews, any connection with any companies, anything in terms of job search. We have paid 6000 euros only for an online course.
- our career coach quite just before we started our Career week leaving us with no guidance or follow up.
Conclusion: We haven't had any help with our job search and the communication with the management is very blurry and not at all transparent.

- Muri, the teacher that came afterwards was amazing and we learned a lot from it

1. It is a lot of hard work normally, but especially if you don't have a strong technical background get ready to put in extra work/time/dedication before and after class and through your weekends. 

2. After all that grinding, you are able to produce 3 awesome projects (which you will be very proud of). However,  your overall grasp on web development is still pretty shallow so be prepared to continue learning and deepening your knowledge even after graduation. This bootcamp is a great starting point! 

And lastly, 3. Even though this class is remote and invites students from anywhere, it is still focused towards South Florida particularly during Career Week where they help you search for jobs and prep you for interviews. Although they do teach you how to search for jobs (with this skill it's applicable  to wherever you are), but many of their references to jobs, companies, connections, speakers, fast track interviews matchmaking system, etc. are all Florida-based, so people who don't live there may feel excluded.

267517,2020.0,False,Most Incredible Experience!,"As someone who didn't previously have a technical background, I wanted to find a school that would not only greatly improve my web development skills, but provide me with a network and framework for career support after the program as well. 

A few highlights below - 

The overall teaching and curriculum is exceptional. The instructors and TA's are amazing at taking foreign concepts and simplifying them and making them MUCH easier to understand. They're so supportive and encouraging every step of the way, and I'm as thankful as can be that they re-ignited my enjoyment and passion towards being a lifelong learner. I learned more in 9 weeks than I could've ever imagined, building awesome projects that may have once seemed impossible to do. 

The career guidance and support that you receive during and especially AFTER the program is equally impressive and exceptional. The program is so structured and geared towards innovative and unique job hunting methods that most aren't even aware of. Brito (the outcomes manager) is there for you every step of the way and is the most selfless person you'll ever meet, gearing his efforts towards seeing his students - past, present and future - succeed. 

The educational benefits and career opportunities that are brought by following the guidance of those at Ironhack are invaluable.

I feel like I’m advertising in this post, but I’m not. It’s just that I had the chance to compare two bootcamps. And if I had to do it all over again, I’d only recommend Ironhack and I will tell you why.
The staff is very professional. Everyday, Katya (Program Manager) bends over backwards to make everything goes smoothly for every single student. 
Guillaume, Frank and Tatijana (teachers) were very patient, always checked that ALL students have understood the current topic before moving on so no-one was left behind. They never rushed a course. They even sometimes stayed late evening.
You won't ever feel like being a customer but a Student. You want to enroll a School before anything else.
Teachers were highly skilled but also extremely good at explaining. 
We had to submit our labs (assignments) daily that teachers review: good for tracking your progress and weak points !
If you are looking for a job after the bootcamp, you will definitely appreciate Morgane’s help: she will give you all the tips you need, and much more.
Unlike some other paris Bootcamps (I won't point them out), Ironhack offers:
• High quality courses, a great student platform with super-rich and almost unlimited content. Not just a 5 line piece of code course :)
• A real job support through CareerHack, and not just an “internship agreement”. :)
• All the resources needed to become a Junior web developer: just work HARD and follow the instructions :)
• More than 7000 other Alumnis from WebDev, Data Science, UX/UI ... we can interact with ! #Goldmine :)
• Ironhack leads to a RNCP VI Certificate that equals a ""Bac + 3/4"" that's really recognized by the french state. No external certificate to take !
• IronBeers every Friday 😜  ❤️    (the courses were so intensive ... we deserved beers 😅)

My advice:
Just make sure you start your pre-work ahead of time so you acquire some fundamentals before starting the bootcamp. Everything is on the Ironhack platform (beforehand, during and after bootcamp). I hope I helped you if you’re comparing bootcamps. 
Ironhack is an American school 🇺🇸  , a mix of a Business School and a military bootcamp: 😅   you’ll literally be ready for code-wars 🔫   😉 ,   not only you’ll feel like an Alumni but also kind of a Veteran 💪  🚀  🔥 .

The Ironhack staff made the online program feel human, natural, and comfortable. I had basic knowledge of most of the topics covered in the curriculum (mostly from a Udemy full-stack web development course), but I never got bored, and I was always busy. For the first few weeks of the program, everything I learned helped fortify and expand my prior knowledge. By the third week, things were getting quite tough.

265331,2020.0,False,About my amazing experience @ Ironhack,"I must say the bootcamp started out in the weirdest situation: quarantine had been announced just a few days before the beginning of the bootcamp and we had to decide if we wanted to follow the course fully remotely from home or postpone to a later cohort.
I decided to stay, and never regreted.
Ironhack's staff transitioned really fast to the remote learning setup and it was seamless. I know they are considering offering remote classes as a standard now, and I couldn't recommend it more. You get to spend more time on actually learning, and the group cohesion actually happened with a few activities that the staff organized.
Apart from that, the program is really well structured. I was so happy to be learning JavaScript and not Ruby which I had considered before, the job market is really keen on JavaScript skills. It actually is a requirement for the job market in most jobs I find while looking for a job now.
The program is complete, really advanced, very fast at times, but I must say I am happy about what I learned and actually learned way more than I thought I would before joining the course. My view is that it is the most ""dev"" oriented bootcamp. I've looked at the syllabus of other webdev bootcamps and they seemed better suited at Product Management or people curious about web development but not intending to go into the hardcore stuff. Ironhack really is techie and professional.
Afterwards, we are being coached by a competent career coach who is following with us our progress. The alumni network is big and people still exchange and help each other after the bootcamp.

265276,2018.0,False,I got to pursue my passion and make life-long friends!,"My experience as a student and later help teacher in Ironhack was nothing short of amazing. As an added bonus, the beer is both cheaper than it was in Oslo (where I'm from) and better, and you get to share that beer with people that - even though you only study with them for 2 months - you will remember and know for the rest of your life. 

I am writing this review 2 years after finishing my bootcamp. One of the things I remember reading about (which I kind of doubted before starting) was the friendship everyone said you develop with co-participants, and how tight you become as a group. 

I was proven wrong. The Ironhack staff of Berlin almost forced us to become good friends! Now now, hear me out. After a first day of introduction games, name games and an already overwhelming amount of work, the participants would go out together and have a drink. And after a hard day's work (and on every Friday!) we would do the same. We had pair-programming everyday during classes and did independent projects in pairs or trios. The work is so intense, and you spend so much time with your peers, that by the time the first week is over, it will feel like you've already known the others for a long time. You end up with a sort of ""us against the work""-mentality because of the sheer amount, where you just have to band together to beat the monster that is the Daily Exercise. 

I feel that I don't really need to say much about the effectiveness of Ironhack's teaching. I got a job after 1 month. I had zero prior coding skills, or even math skills, just an interest for gaming and technology. Most of my cohort got a job in way less time, many even before the camp ended. 

I got to be a help teacher after my bootcamp and can give a few tips, as some of the difficulties students had were similar in the next group. 
- Read up and get as good as you can before the bootcamp. I was not particularly well prepared (I would say average to below average skill level), and had to work that much more. Don't do what I did. Don't procrastinate the pre-work. The workload is massive, and ""getting back on track"" when you start off-track is really, really hard. 
- Additionally, go out with the other participants! Get a beer (or ten)! Switch places in the classroom! Say yes to all the outings and beers and lunches and whatnot. Remember that when you're done there, your skill level is only one part of the picture. Your network and friendships are the stuff you actually remember. And practially speaking, I now have multiple contacts within the tech industry from all around the world. So make it a good experience by having fun, and not drowning in the work, and it's a win-win.
- Take some distance. Take at least one day off per week. Don't ""use the weekend to get back on track"" (you will say this at some point). You will need the time off in the long run, just trust me on that.",6/8/2020,Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

I never heard of them before, they were not the cheapest but I was not worried about price but I wanted to get the best experience out there. 

I did the full time cohort and it has changed my life forever. I was previous cold calling small businesses for a living for about 4 years and I quickly realized that I needed a valued skill that I can build on. I was highly interested in programming so I decided to pursue it full time! It was not easy.. the bootcamp was 400 hours however I put in well around 1000 hours into 9 weeks. It was so worth it! 4 months later, I am writing this but now have a great job position doing what I genuinely feel that I love doing, programming. 

The most important skill set I feel that I received the understanding how to learn and that it's okay to feel incapable even though you are completely capable. 

The staff was very easy to work with! Sometimes you have your doubts if they are really there for you to help but I understood that is just a way to make you use your brain and learn your self. I also felt some disorganization during enrollment however that was not the case as the admissions manager was actually replaced and they actually were very on top of their game! 

When I originally signed up for Ironhack Full Time Web Dev cohort I was very excited for the in person experience but then COVID hit and nobody was prepared. I had my doubts that I would learn anything but Ironhack over exceeded my expectations. It seemed as if they prepared since the beginning! Today, I would choose to do it all over again remotely compared to in person. I feel that I would have more time to code after classes since I am at home compared to making the commute and then later finding time to open my laptop again.

The career week has been outstanding and tons of practical help to back you up with applying and finding your first position! I was fortunate enough to find a job even before the career week started but choose to do it anyways to better understand for future opportunities. 

Overall, coming from somebody with 0 technical background, I would highly recommend Ironhack to anybody that asks me.

Even going into the course, I knew that it would not be worth the 7000eur I was paying. The students were ready to give a lot toward the course, unfortunately, the teacher and TAs were not. I was dismayed to find out that the course teacher used to previously teach coding at a different academy. Because of this, we got zero intro on even the basics of UI, other than a vague introduction to color theory. There was only a passing mention of material design and design systems. Now I work as a UI UX designer, after 6 months of trying to find a job. I work solely on UI, which is what any entry level designer will be expected to do. 
During the course, we also focused on learning to code, which- sure was useful but did not need to be a priority in the short 2 month course. A lot of the coding teaching was done by the TA, who was quite a nice person but definitely not suited for teaching. 

Which bring me to how Ironhack also pumps up its employment percentage. It employs its students from previous courses as its TAs. This is unfair, I would hope that TAs would atleast have a 1year experience as a UI UX designer. 

Overall, its a fun environment and I made some great friends. In terms of learning, I did most of it myself after I graduated.

264014,2019.0,False,"Good Surprises, Bad surprises, Good Surprises","Well it was a very intense experience. I enrolled myself on the full time web development bootcamp. It was  a lot of hard work , a lot of homework, a lot of things to learn in so short time, and a lot of code to submit that same night.   Very little hours of sleep and usually thinking and dreaming about code.
My story started with company lay-off, so I was unemployed looking for job and counting my money and looking for a way to make it last, a friend of mine recommended me IronHack, ""you could change carriers as I did"" , that sounded good ! and at least it could be an attractive boost to my current skills. I was having doubts but the day I payed the bootcamp a visit they talk me about some financing options, so I took some days to do my budget and gave it a green light, I enrolled in the next FT bootcamp. 
As I mentioned early, it was hard and challenging,  if you have zero coding background (math is not that important) you better enroll in the part time bootcamp, if you had some coding subjects in school you just need to apply (a lot) yourself, if you know how to code but you want to learn fast and with help the bootcamp stack then it is a very good jump start for learning the language and the tools.   Maybe you come from a different background that is not technology, if that is your case consider first the halftime bootcamp because it can get frustrating how little time you have and how many things you got to learn and how complex are the projects you have to deliver. 
My lead teachers were very good, very young (considering the average of my career teachers) but they were awesome coders and dedicated about teaching , sometimes a little cocky; my teacher assistants were good maybe sometimes hard to find or not as crafty as one would like, they were always well intentioned even the times the fix they gave you crashed your code, but every bootcamp has different teachers and assistants so only fortune can tell who your teachers are going to be. One thing I can tell you, yes the program will include the most fitted technologies to go and search for a job and enough knowledge to get you started as an entry level programmer, depending on how easy if for you to build upon those  skills is who much more you can achieve in your job search, the other skills that you learned before also add up to that. 
In few words my bootcamp experience was very good,just remember,  you need to be up to the task. 
About my job quest and job support experience, I can tell you that my job support has been very good, very unique times (covid pandemic) to be looking for job, I notice that the technology market keeps growing and keeps hiring people at least more than the other markets,some of them 
 are shrinking or paused, so I cannot tell at this moment if the same rules of the year before apply to my future job and salary offers, but I'm glad the Tech and coding market is still hiring and growing. 
It is a great and outstanding work and support the one being made by the ""hiring support team"" I can tell that it makes a difference in your favor to have them, ( I notice because I pass many months looking for job by myself before the bootcamp), so it is awesome to have them once you finish the bootcamp, It is not a walk in the park, it is still demanding looking for a job but the burden is less. 

Is it worth it ? well, short answer YES,   is not cheap ( try looking for a scholarship or financing help); the end is just the beginning, as you finish the bootcamp you notice that there are SO many different technologies, tools and languages out there that it gets a little overwhelming, so look into the things you like and apply yourself on learning those new things you want or need.
I have many thing to tell but I think these word are good enough to give you an idea of the experience.

Ironhack gave me all the supplies I needed to be able to become a UX Designer, not only with an incredible study content, a tremendous teacher and teacher assistants but also the support, in general, to reallocate myself as a professional.
I was gifted with a teacher from the real market that showed us how important empathy is, and how this should be encouraged from the very beginning. It all started inside our classroom, with experiences and projects that inspired us to be empathetic not only with our users but with ourselves and among us, as classmates (and later good friends).
We were able to be in touch with the whole Design Thinking and Double Diamond process, and we could untangle each step of the methodologies to both understand when we should apply it and how to apply it. We still have integral support, even after the course, since we all became good professional and life friends. 
Also, even during hard times, there are always companies getting in touch with me, and I can notice how attractive my curriculum is now, and I know I owe this to this experience I had.

Whether I get accepted or not is on me, but the fact that most of us who graduated in March 2020 are being contacted by companies says a lot about Ironhack's reputation (and the high demand of web devs in France)

The full time program which lasted for 9 weeks was intense. We were expected to build projects whether or not we fully understood the concepts - which could either be good or bad for a student depending on their learning style - but anyone who needed help, got help. I was surrounded by other students who have the same goals as me and who have helped me get through coding challenges. The teaching assistants - Frank, Clara, PH, and Tatijana - were very helpful most especially during project week when we were all somewhat free-diving; and our lead instructor, Guillaume, was a good source of knowledge and was very patient with us noobs in answering all technical questions. 

As for job support, it is nice to have Dina and Morgane as our cheerleaders in finding our new roles. They have been sending weekly emails since our program ended,  giving us structure and motivating us in our job hunting journey. They helped us in revamping our LinkedIn profiles and CVs, and also in preparing for interviews. We were supposed to have a hiring fair where we can meet with company reps in person, but because of the corona virus situation, the event has been postponed. But, our profiles were still sent out to the companies that know about Ironhack and got contacted by them.

And wait. It is important to mention that it was not all just work. We also had seminars and weekly fun activities that gave us opportunity to connect in a personal level -- all these events organized by our program manager, Katya.

So again for someone who just moved to a new country, this was overall a great experience in many aspects - I've made friends and I've learned new skills enough for me to land a junior dev role in France.

The Ironhack teams, educational and admin, are truly exceptional. I have rarely seen an organization in which everyone has a real concern for doing high quality work, in this case offering students excellent training and a great experience.

On the course side, the Lead Teacher and Teacher assistants  combo works very well. All are very available and helpful, and set up a framework as serious as motivating, pleasant, really a nice balance found! This is appropriate: the training is very dense and you need a good motivation to follow and store all the information shared. The online platform offering lessons and exercises (available for life) is also very well done, and full of useful resources (good luck to anyone who wants to exhaust it!). The training is well sequenced between the course modules and the projects, which are an opportunity to apply the learning and above all to take enormous pleasure in building our first websites.

Now that experience has settled, I'm extremely grateful to having the possibility in meeting such a unique and inspiring bunch of people. 

The program is structured in a way to reflect the crazy pace in the industry itself. I double checked with my network and it's official, since companies are getting more and more design focused.

We add projects, and they might seem scary and the time sometimes seem short but in the end they are totally worth it. They are a consolidation of your learning, and you will see how much you grow with them.
It was so intense and interesting  that we rarely add time to think about other things but the support from the teacher and the staff is always top notch. There was never a time that I felt alone, even now that we needed to transit to remote we have total support from the Ironhack family!

I'm trying to figure out some cons but for me it's hard because I really came out of it feeling as a better person and with a lot of relevant tools in my arsenal that are importante for the job market.
The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that I didn't have time to properly say goodbye to some of my colleagues that needed to return home without much of a notice due to the covid-19 outbreak.

263857,2020.0,False,Life changing experience,"<p>I have just finished a course in Data Analytics in Ironhack Lisbon, and I can happily say this was one of the wisest decisions I have ever made. I have accomplished many goals in a short amount of time, from technical skills to strengthening my resilience and acquiring new learning methods and tools. I applied to this course very early (8 months before I started) which allowed me to thoroughly study the topics beforehand. However, it was only during the course that I really got the grasp of everything I know right now on Python, Pandas, Web Scrapping, SQL, Statistics in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc. This is not all though, we had numerous talks about topics concerning data analysis such as Business Intelligence, Object Oriented Programming, Mongo DB, Django and many more. It would be an endless list if I continued mentioning all the skills I have acquired. This really opened my job opportunities despite the current crisis with COVID109. In fact, I believe this was the right moment in my life to dive into tech as the job market is now changing and becoming more conscious of the importance of digitization. I recommend Ironhack to anyone who is studying Programming on their own and/or wants to change their career towards tech. I have tried multiple courses online before this but nothing can compare. This is will be hard work, so be conscious of that. For 2 months you will be studying and working on projects nonstop. At the same time you will have great and supportive staff and colleagues who will be there for you not only to help you out but to share a laugh with. My advice is for you to take a good look at the syllabus and review beforehand the topics you think you may struggle with. Personally, for me, was Statistics (I come from a humanities educational background) and I needed more time with on this than some of my colleagues. During the bootcamp it will be hard for you to keep reviewing the same topic because you are constantly learning new things. Prioritize your time as best as you can! Overall, great experience.

263856,2020.0,False,Ironhack - Best decision ever !,"After seven years in the Fashion Industry, I decided to build a career that would fit me better. I like languages, I like computers, I like logic and challenges... I was advised to look into web-development, so where to start ? After deciding on taking a bootcamp (I like fast paced environments and structured learning) it was now to choose : which one ?

Based on languages taught, and previous students feedback, and after asking senior devs around me, I went to Ironhack. For two months and a half I ate code for every meal : it's very intense, and you have to remain calm and confident through the whole thing, giving your best and trusting the process. For me ? It worked. In nine weeks I won't have the pretention to say ""Yeah I'm totally a fullstack dev"" but I coded three projects, the last wining an award from my school. I'm now able to start coding my own things, and I discovered something I love and want to work in.

The teaching team has been very supporting from start to finish, I made good friends even if I was expecting a 9 to 6 gig, and I really liked the general atmosphere put in place to make everyone feel at home. Before finishing my bootcamp, I've been offered a TA position for the next sessions, and the chance to help others have the same experience I had, and challenging myself into debugging students on problems I was struggling with a few weeks before was very tempting : I said yes. They've been very reactive when the lockdown took set in France, and we're now running the session in remote, we maintained the friendly atmosphere and we give everything to make our students feel the same support and mentoring as if they were physically in the classroom. Javascript all the way (Node and React) are stacks that get you hired, that's what we teach.

I would like to stick around for a while, and find a position in a company, and why not launch myself as a freelance in a year or two ! Career wise, we're coached every step of the way : workshops, support, custom path tracking, and goals setting. Even remotely, they reach out to us and make sure we have the best tools / clues as to where / how to get the job we want, and that's a big plus that wasn't on the ""brochure"" of every bootcamp.

I would totally recommend this school to people who are not afraid to work hard, sweat and challenge themselves.

At first I was doubting if a bootcamp would be a good thing to do. In the end, I pulled the trigger. Finished yesterday, met great people and learned a lot. I'd highly recommend this programme and here is why:

Pro's:
- The programme is varied. We had 3 UX projects, 3 UI, 1 coding and 1 final project. Sometimes you would be in groups of 4, 3 or 2 and also just by yourself.
- Because of the small group nature of the programme, you get to know everyone and work with almost anyone.
- Our teacher and teaching staff were knowledgeable, caring but also challenging and demanding. You will get feedback. But this will help you grow. And it's always constructive feedback.
- The programme manager and other administrative staff. They were constantly improving the campus. I.e. with new furniture, branding, ping pong table and so much more.
- External speakers and UI workshop were a big thing.

Cons:
- In the beginning their were certain things that did not go well. Small things for instance the online material was a bit different from the class material. Or some supplies were not always restocked. However, we had a retrospective after each project. The teacher would use our feedback and make sure those things and more were improved.
- Corona virus. Our final project had to take place online. Naturally, the school had to be closed and this was out of their hands. The online environment were good and quickly developed.

The curriculum is very well structured, teaching you the fundamentals and problem solving skills before diving into more code specific details.

263594,2020.0,False,"High demand, even higher reward","After completing my Masters on Industrial Engineering, I was looking for opportunities to start a professional career as a Data Scientist. However, most of the job positions available in the field, required a high level of knowledge in programming languages like Python, R and SQL, which I didn't have.
To improve my technical skills on Data Analytics, I decided to join the IronHack Data Analytics bootcamp in Lisbon. This decision turned out to be an amazing add on to my existing set of skills and made me a much better engineer.

Experience summary:
- High workload;
- High complexity on the topics;
- So many new and useful things learned!
- Machine Learning module is awesome, but short.
- Very competent teaching staff;
- Super responsible and caring administrative staff;
- Cool extra seminars along the bootcamp, for example: Build an ETL Pipeline, Build a Django App;
- Beer and pizza offered by IronHack on events! :)

Detailed experience:

The program is very well distributed. The first weeks were mainly dedicated to learn basic programming and to clean data in Python. Since, data cleaning is such an important feature on a Data Scientist, the program has a very intensive approach on this subject (Very cool and useful!). We also spent a few days learning SQL, which is great, because it gives you a feel of the data warehousing task.   
Then, we learned how to manipulate data and make it 'readable' for everyone, using super interesting data visualization libraries and software. At this point, we were only at the first part of the bootcamp. The workload was really high and the tasks were not easy, but I was learning so much! I thought it couldn't get more difficult, but then, second part of the bootcamp came on...
After this point not only the workload increased, but the complexity of the subjects studied also increased! We started going deep on Statistics. This was a very challenging and important part of the bootcamp, since Statistics are one of the stepping stones of Data Analytics. 
The last weeks were dedicated to the coolest topic (in my opinion) - Machine Learning! We got to learn multiple algorithms and techniques to develop prediction projects. In the last project on campus (2 weeks project), we had to develop a Machine Learning Model and present our results. I was really happy and excited on the last weeks, cause I got to see and feel the potential of an amazing technology like Machine Learning. However, I got the feeling that we needed to dedicate more time on the Machine Learning module. The program should be reviewed in the sense that it should dedicate more time to study Deep Learning. 

The teaching staff was very competent! We had 4 teachers available - 1 lead teacher and 3 assistant teachers. They were really good educating  and there was always someone available to help. Very effective teaching system!

Besides the technical characteristics and the teaching staff of the program,  I also feel that is important to refer that the administrative IronHack staff was really amazing with me. They not not only did a good job on a professional level, but also, on a personal level. Very responsible and caring staff!",4/15/2020,Data Analytics Bootcamp,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack
263589,2020.0,False,Perfect to start .. but it also depends on you!,"The ironhack will certainly be marked in my life, not only for the quality of the course itself. But for the 10 weeks that felt like 1 year and the friendships that I built on that journey.
In 9 weeks of class all past knowledge is valid, maybe one detail or another is missing but if you learn everything they are willing to teach you will leave 1000% better than you entered. They always try to catch up with the market and are super attentive. My class was harmed by the situation of COVID and by the job manager having resigned on hiring week, because of that I am not the best to indicate a note of Job Support. But among those who remain there is a lot of effort to try to help us as much as possible.
Do the Ironhack, live the Ironhack, believe in the process and give yourself 110%, you will not regret it, just be willing and with time for it, plan and have a money reserve when you graduate because it will depend a lot on the market demand , you can get a job in the first month or only after three, it also depends a little on you when looking for a job and improving your knowledge after the course.",4/15/2020,Web Development Bootcamp,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack

263555,2019.0,False,Web dev Berlin could be better,"I feel obligated to write a review for this course because I have very mixed feelings about the experience. I will try to be as honest as possible. 

Before the course starts, students must complete prework assignments based off an online learning platform. The platform was a good start but didn’t always provide all necessary information or enough examples to completely understand the material. The TAs are available to help, but in my experience they didn’t always get back to me right away (I later learned why—the TAs are extremely overworked). The prework needs improving because there’s no good way to accurately see if you’ve learned enough before the course starts, even by completing the two assignments. 

As for the course itself: class was from 9-18:00 but if you’re taking it seriously, you’ll stay several extra hours to complete the lab assignments. It’s lots of self-learning. The website is accurate in its structure of the day, with lectures and labs interspersed. They’re good at giving you lots of breaks, which you’ll need. The TAs are amazing and work hard to help you, sometimes sitting down for long periods of time to debug your code. Personally I think they did more than the teacher and deserve more pay/credit. 

On the other hand, the fact that TAs can help you whenever and assignments are often done with partners, it’s hard to know if you truly understand the material. You might be completing assignments after receiving help from others, so it’s hard to gauge whether you’ve comprehended it all. Personally I felt like my TAs coded my entire project because I didn’t understand any of it, while the feedback from the TAs was very positive. I therefore felt there was a huge discrepancy because they couldn’t truly see how people were doing. When I tried to advocate for myself, they always just told me I was fine. 

The projects overall are a great way to break into a new career. You’ll learn a lot and add to your portfolio. Additionally, you’ll do 1/2 daily labs, mini projects, so you’ll build up a good foundation. After the bootcamp I think learning online would be impossible. IH barely scratches the surface, and to learn the same amount without a bootcamp would take years, especially without help from peers. 

On the other hand, I personally think IH isn’t the right bootcamp anymore. Perhaps it once was, but its career services leave something to be desired (in the case of my class: a career). Our hiring week took place right before Christmas, so it might as well not have happened, as no one hires then anyway. After that, we received only a couple emails within the three months after graduating, not nearly enough compared to the services promised. They also weren’t overly available for meetings so scheduling usually wasn’t instantaneous, and my meetings were short and seemingly unproductive. They told me things I already know. More frustrating is the fact that of all the people in my class looking for a new job, only a small number got hired within those three months, probably well below a 50% hiring rate, or even 30%. 

Overall, a bootcamp may or may not be a good decision, but for the financial and physical and mental health costs, IH is not the best choice.",4/14/2020,Web Development Bootcamp,3.0,[],3.0,4.0,2.0,ironhack

My first project at a data science company was to create a program that extracts information from a website and my notes from the ""Web scraping lab"" were tremendously useful. I solved it in no time. 

Cons: Some labs are outdated or not challenging enough. Some datasets are used so often you get bored. More exposure to key principles and fundamentals would be helpful.

The 9 weeks were very intense both in and out of the classroom, It’s a bootcamp after all. The curriculum is substantial and it’s virtually impossible to go over every topic at any given week, which was frustrating to me as I wanted to have lectures and learn about everything! I put in a good 12-hour day studying schedule and that included weekends working on my case studies, doing research and catching up on the design challenges and lectures not talked about in the classroom. I quickly realized that at the end of the day you get what you put in. If you don’t take it seriously and are diligent about completing all your assignments, research, case studies, presentations and blog posts on-time you will be wasting your time, money and resources. 
The staff is nice and courteous, my instructor David was very knowledgeable with tons of experience as a seasoned designer who worked hard to get us a well-known company to work with us for our final project. My TAs Nicole and Maikel were one of the best I’ve ever had, equally resourceful, friendly and amazing professionals. The facilities are pretty good, located in a co-working space building where a few tech companies operate, which is cool. There are daily treats offered by the building, a vending and a coffee machine, and a nice kitchen where you can have your meals plus plenty of restaurants close by. Also, several rooms and areas are available within the building to work on your assignments outside the classroom which was very helpful since I often stayed late working on my projects.
Career services is one of the best things Ironhack has to offer. Daniel Brito, the outcomes manager is constantly teaching workshops and having one-on-ones with you to make sure you are following his directions and preparing for your new career. Once you’re done with the cohort, there’s a career week where you sit through lectures and dedicate time to work on your LinkedIn profile, portfolio website and interview techniques among other things. The last week of the cohort is dedicated to a hiring fair where local companies come to an event organized by Daniel to interview students for work opportunities. I’m happy my hard work paid off as I was hired shortly after by one of the companies I interviewed with.
In conclusion, Ironhack will teach you a comprehensive curriculum, give you valuable tools in a nice environment, help you find a job to launch your UX/UI career and offer you a lifelong platform to always be current and part of the tech industry but you need to be dedicated, driven, resourceful and diligent about it.",2/16/2020,UX/UI Design Bootcamp,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack

The full time programs are all very demanding of your time and energy. If you're a complete newcomer to coding, I suggest dedicating as much time as possible to the pre-work. Also, brushing up on statistics is a good idea for data analytics. The only caveat I have about the full time program is that it passes very quickly.

The most beneficial part of Ironhack in my mind was the career services portion. Daniel Brito and career week prepared me in terms of portfolio, linked in, resume, and interview skills. Without his help I would not have the job that I do.

I found all the staff to be encouraging and helpful. I learned a lot about ux process and methodology but most importantly classes gave me a structure with which I was able to make my portfolio shine. 

I think that if I did not have previous experience with some of the design tools, Ironhack would have been significantly more difficult.

The material taught for Full-Stack Web Development is very relevant to the Miami tech community and for many locations nationally. I’m not going to say that I enjoyed every single thing that was taught because some of it (small portion) turned out to be irrelevant, but what’s great is that they take your feedback into consideration and can update the curriculum. I know the curriculum was updated to remove the irrelevant material and was replaced with better material for the cohort that followed mine.

During, and after you graduate, you'll have extensive job assistance opportunities like (Linkedin and resume help and a career fair), you just have to make sure you’re putting in the effort. No one is guaranteed a job, nowhere are you really it’s all about your efforts in the job hunt, but you are guaranteed the skills and tools that will be relevant in the workforce for a Full-Stack Development job. I know the price is a factor for a lot of people, but you’ll find that it’s much cheaper than studying at a college/university and you’re done a lot sooner with a large skillset under your belt.

I hope this helps remove any doubts you might have about joining Ironhack! :)

258521,2019.0,False,Not worth the money,"I joined Ironhack UX/UI full-time design bootcamp after recommendation and many positive reviews I read on the Internet. It is important to notice here than Ironhack has many locations and for sure there is a lot of differences between them - actually it's hard to find them about this specific course in Berlin, so this is why I decided to write my opinion here.
Maybe I will start from positive part here. The working environment it's really amazing, mostly due to the people who participate in the course. It's really great to work with people with different skills and with various background - everyone was very supportive, kind and helpful. When you are stuck with anything, you can always count on your classmates. Also, I think the curriculum is well constructed and contains the most important information - of course, it's super intense and it's not possible to remember everything from the lectures but you will get a forever access to the learning platform - pretty helpful. The cool building, comfortable chairs and the free barista were also big advantages :)
Before joining the course, I studied carefully the info and details on their websites. For sure, Ironhack promises a lot and it's not suprising, beacuse the bootcamps are very expensive (and getting even more). I would like to refer here to some of their promises.
First of all the, the group was bigger than they promised, and way bigger than in the different locations. I was counting for a small group and pair work experience, instead it was more like back-to-school and 4 people in the group way of working - way too much.
First of all, the lead teacher is not a UX/UI designer, but a visual designer, and actually he is not even really interested in the UX part and as he admitted, he has never really worked with it. I expected him to have a broad knowledge about UX, but it was pretty limited to the slides he was presenting. Also, he was very hardly accessible - he was usually leaving early or were always busy with something else. To be honest, he didn't seem really interested in the job.
Ironhack presents itself as a team ""tech spec"" - but a lot of times they are just lacking skills. The teacher and TA are definitely not specialist in the softwares that are used during the course - it's very disappointing. During the career week, some invited people to the school seemed pretty random - maybe just to fill our time with something? I'm not sure if inviting a person who is an ex-TA who doesn't have a job yet as an ""interview specialist"" or doing negotiation workshops with a person who has no experience with it is the best idea... I think Ironhack should really take closer look at the people who they are hiring - both the teacher and TAs seem often unmotivated and not really engaged in their work. I understand they are not professional designers but sometimes their advice and knowledge is lower that the participants of the course. And also, complaining about students in the common areas, where everyone can hear it, is VERY unprofessional.
Overall, I learned a lot during the course, but it was a lot of my individual work I put in it and also from people I ask for advice from - unfortunately I can't say the staff was really helpful. I think that Ironhack is not a bad school, but for this price, people's expectations were way higher, what almost everyone admitted at the end. At the moment, I'd advice to think twice before joining campus in Berlin and maybe to consider different locations.",11/7/2019,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,2.7,[],3.0,4.0,1.0,ironhack

258125,2019.0,False,Best choice of my life,"I'll be totally sincere: back in March, when I decided to quit my job and start coding again, the ""bootcamp"" idea seemed to me as ""too much of a promise"". To teach someone how to code from scratch in 9 weeks? ""Impossible! Or it will be extremely superficial."" - I though. I had a background of a 3-year technical programming course and 12 years of coding logic (and even though I knew the basics of programming).
I couldn't be more wrong.

The first 3 days I was learning what I already knew (with some new twists that didn't exist when I learned the first time). No surprises and still the same ""this will be superficial"" thought. From day 4 to the end of the course, I've never learned SO MUCH in so little time. And I'm not exaggerating.
Ironhack teaches you not just how to do something specific, but how to think about the problems you have and how to solve them (with what you know or how to search for the answer you need).
It may seem that 9 weeks are too little for learning how to code. But I prefer to think that It's OVER 500 HOURS of course (240h of pure classes, +/-120h of extra-class content and 180h of your own projects - where you'll really learn everything you saw with 'sweat and blood'). That's way over coding you'll see in a Computer Science's bachelor semester (or even a year).

I've been even more surprised to see my colleagues (that had NO programming background) to became capable full stack developers and all of them to be working within 2 months after the end of the course.

257919,2018.0,False,"If you decide on doing a coding bootcamp, this is it.","Ok, let's start. I waited a year before I reviewed IH because I did not want my review to be biased. I haven't had contact any with the people at IH so I can give you the closest thing to an objective opinion out there. 

Here it comes: 

Ironhack is easily the best choice of my life, no questions asked. Without any kind of background in technology, just hard work, the curriculum and help provided by the Ironhack staff I was able to find a job before I even finished the bootcamp.

So if you want to know if I think you should do Ironhack: the answer is YES.

That's all. Don't read the rest unless you want to read my personal experience.

 

Now I will write what I think about each part of Ironhack:

 

Curriculum: Look, this is why you are here, this is what you like, this is what you enjoy doing. You will have classes imparted by a teacher where you will have fun from start to finish, it might be rough, it might be tough but its always fun. I went by this curriculum and it actually help me understand coding and gave me great foundations on how to study and learn new technologies. I still go about learning new technologies the same way I did at Ironhack. If you follow this curriculum(understanding it, reading it before class and then solving every doubt you have during classes) and finish EVERY part of it(even the ""extras"") you will leave Ironhack knowing enough to get hired anywhere.

Instructors: My teacher was Nick Borbe, my TAs were Marcos Palacios and Manuel Cabrera. Everyone was great, super helpful and knowledgeable. If at any point they did not know the answer to something you asked they would look into it and comeback with the answer. Great people all around. 

Job Assistance: Ironhack is the best, and that's in no small part thanks to Daniel Brito, this guy will find you a job. He won't hold your hand during the process but if he sees you putting in 200% he will put in 300%. Make use of him, ask him questions, show him you are interested and he will help you.

 

Overall: As with any other course or any type of education process you will get back what you put in. If this is really what you want I can't think of a better place to learn the basics of coding/programming/web develpment than at Ironhack. They helped me change my life for the better, I'm finally happy with what I do and actually miss work when I'm on vacation. All of this started with Ironhack and I will never forget it.

If you are still undecided I invite you to add me on linkedin and ask me any question about Ironhack and my experience there, I'll be more than happy to answer.",10/21/2019,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

256206,2018.0,True,Revamped my portfolio,"I enrolled in the full-time UX/UI design program last fall (2018). My teacher and the Ironhack staff were friendly, helpful, and very open to listening and improving the lessons in any way possible. Unfortunately the TA I started the program with only held the position for a couple of weeks and then this spot was filled by a number of temporary replacements. This didn’t allow me to get very close to any of those people and it felt like a resource that I expected to have wasn’t really available that cohort. In the end, we turned to fellow classmates for supplemental help most of all and this teamwork really helped many of us. The course is very intense and incoming students should expect to be stressed out by the workload. A lot of information is packed into a few months, so it’s important to bookmark all of the important websites your teacher shows you and of course to take good notes! If you have past work experience that relates at all to the duties of a UX/UI designer or even if you just had a strong interest in parts of the process, this will come in handy! I’d always had an interest in art and had done some graphic design before. On the other hand, if you have zero relevant experience and were interested in completing this course, I would say to be patient and realistic about where your skills might be by graduation time. While I do think Ironhack can give you a boost and help you get started with your new career, I saw some classmates struggle with creating professional-looking visual designs- even by the end of the course.  So if you’re doing something difficult for the first time, don’t expect a miracle. That said… coding week was not great for me. Most of the other students had had at least a little bit of exposure to coding before the course, so they were able to keep up with the instructor. A few students (including me) had never had any exposure and we fell behind and could never catch up. I was repeatedly told that it was ok if I knew nothing about coding, but it felt like a little more understanding was necessary to understand the fast-talking teacher I had for coding week. Daniel Brito was my career coach while I was there and I really appreciated his support. He gave me a lot of awesome advice and helped me see things from the perspective of the employer. Although he was busy assisting lots of students, he did a good job of dividing up his time and giving me his full attention when it was my turn. In the end, I walked away with a portfolio that helped me get my current job, so it was worth it for me! Plus it’s nice to be part of the Ironhack network.",10/8/2019,,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack

Ironhack seemed like an excellent decision because I had heard of them, and had recommendations from students who already finished that Bootcamp. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to be one of the winners of a full scholarship at Ironhack. I felt amazing and closer to where I wanted to go.

Ironhack helped me acquire skills for this new digital economy, how to build my network, work as a team and with deadlines, and how to use these latest technologies to undertake your projects. All the classes we attend are very practical with real-world challenges and that you are experienced to go from a beginner to advanced level and acquire that way of solving problems thinking as a programmer.

The Ironhack team is amazing, they will be your mentors and friends who will guide you and always look for your best. They are very professional and fun. Once you have completed Bootcamp, the team organizes a Hiring Fair to help you get a job and train you for the world of work. The experience is very challenging and with a lot opportunities , that definitely it will help you succeed.

Finally, having concluded with Ironhack, I find myself working thanks to their support, and my efforts.

255316,2019.0,True,Great for the right audience,"I came across Ironhack's program while hunting for UX/UI bootcamps. I've been a designer/strategist for about 8 years, and as a full-time freelancer, I wanted more structure around the UX/UI process and the work I could be doing better for my clients. Turns out, I already had a solid enough background that I likely needed a step up from what Ironhack had to offer. That said, I think the program is great for the right audience– people who are looking to change careers or don't have a background in design or creative problem solving at all whatsoever. 

The pros:
- The curriculum is ever-changing with the times and the Ironhack staff did a good job making course corrections as our cohort went on.
- It's a great base for anyone looking to learn UX/UI as a new skill/career path.
- The class size is pretty small and the relationships forged are great for post-graduation.
- We had a number of opportunities to network with past alumni and hear about what/how they're doing now.

The cons:
- Execution of the curriculum felt a bit disjointed and disorganized. We did too many super short projects to be able to really dig deep and learn any nuances.
- The coding week was a disaster– it was entirely unplanned and we didn't get additional resources until three days into the week. At $1000+/week, 3 wasted days is not cheap.
- This may not be a con to everyone, but the program and the Ironhack staff were a bit too chill for me. There were a lot of rules that they really drove home at the beginning... but never followed through on. The execution was lacking and we ended up being treated like both children and adults simultaneously.
- We were promised things repeatedly that we never received. (For example, we were supposed to have professional headshots taken, but the photographer was a no-show and the staff chose not to reschedule for us. Our headshots were taken on an iPhone. Again– at $12k/person, we should be able to reschedule a photographer.) A lot of little things like that added up to a negative experience.

For my situation personally, I made the best decision I could with the information I had. I'm leaving this review 4 months after graduating and I'm neutral about my experience now. I met some really great people and I learned enough– but I probably wouldn't do it again (and I won't rave about the experience).",9/26/2019,,3.0,[],3.0,3.0,,ironhack

As a recent graduate of Ironhack full-time web development course I'm here to tell you to do it. It is totally worth it and will affect your life in a positive way. 
There is one thing that all this unsure or negative bootcamp reviews have in common - they all are by software engineers and developers. Think about it. The person attended the top bootcamp - and then he/she is a developer. Full stop. If you putt in the effort, put in the hours and do what they tell you to do, learn what they offer you to learn then this will be your story. Whatever background you come from - it is doable to step into the fascinating world of technology. I know it because I'm telling my own story. 
          I went through full stack web dev course and learned MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS and the list goes on and on. But most important I've learned that I can do it. I've learned how to think and how to approach the technical challenge that I'm facing. I got the whole lot of new connections, relevant to the field as well.
The IronHack Miami staff is all you can ask for. Nobody here looks at titles and everybody are here to help in any way they can. Instructor Nick Borbe is no less the programming guru, calm, knowledgeable and with the rare ability to talk simple about complicated concepts. TA's Nick, Marcos, Mike are always, I mean always there from morning until late at night to review your code and to ensure that your road to become a developer is a smooth one. 
People at Ironhack Miami know and love their craft and it is of a great value.

He will push you, coach you, challenge you, advice you and do it all over again until you find your new work place. He will put you in the room with right people to present yourself for the job that is not even on the market. And you will get it, because you will know exactly what to do and how to do it. Let me tell you, in the tech field of Miami if you don't know Brito and he doesn't know you - you are not on the map. And after Ironhack you will be on the map.

I do recommend to anyone that wants to attend this camp has some previous learning in order to get a better experience. Do the prework that they require but also go beyond and try to learn more programming. If you expect going into the bootcamp without having any interest in programming you may discover that programming is not for you, but this won't be the bootcamps fault rather than yours.

He preps you on how to land a great job, he teaches you how to speak and reach out to companies and make yourself known. I applied many of his tactics and it helped me improve and build a reputation for myself in another city.

It is focused on practical labs everyday and we develop curriculum by doing three big projects.

The workload is extreme and the material challenging but it is a highly rewarding experience were you are rewarded for pushing yourself. Thankfully the atmosphere is extremely friendly with amenities galore to make yourself more comfortable. I spent most of the course working outside on the beautiful rooftop astroturf patio. 

My instructor Nico was a very committed teacher who would personally invest in any problems you were working on, help you realize your vision and work with you to find a solution. Anything answers he didn't have, he knew how to find them! In general Nico was great person who was easy talk to and made you feel comfortable throughout the learning process.

The curriculum itself is well thought-out and constantly changing. You really feel you are learning whatever technology is the most relevant. It was a frequent topic of conversation how many of us who went to college (even some Computer Science majors) couldn't believe how much more we were learning in such a short time compared to our drawn out struggles with traditional universities. Struggles that ultimately left us feeling unprepared for the real world...and robbed!

Ironhack attracts plenty of motivated people who are a pleasure to be in class with. The sense of camaraderie is strong and It feels good to be in deep with the your fellow classmates. We all worked hard together, helped each other out and bonded over struggling with the same difficult sections.

Thankfully Ironhack was good about making sure there are some unwinding opportunities. Lisa and Jess did an excellent job of keeping the energy up and organizing much needed stress relief moments that gave everyone an opportunity to unplug, eat some pizza and drink a little beer (or kombucha).

Finally Brito is there to make sure we stayed focused on the reason most of us joined the course: To get jobs! Brito helped us prioritize what's important in terms of our future careers. He has tons of extremely useful experience in terms of what companies are looking for when hiring talent. He makes us looks good and gives us pro tips on building out resumes and our Linkedins. 

Brito also does an excellent job bringing in tech veterans to share their knowledge with us. We've had speakers talk to us about the hiring process, the tech world, problems we may face, and even set up mock technical and soft skill interviews. If you have a specific interest in something in particular Brito will connect you with someone from his MASSIVE and beautifully organized list of tech contacts and Ironhack alum. Brito works very hard and is constantly finding new opportunities for graduates to pursue.

Prior to Ironhack I was exhausting myself working as a cook and making next to nothing.  As someone who is now happily working as a web developer, signing up for Ironhack was one of the smartest moves I've ever made.

The first weeks were certainly very overwhelming for me, who never seen nothing regarding code until starting to study the ""pre-work"" that we had, weeks before the Bootcamp even started. The team informed us about the intensity and the challenges we would face, and they were very right! However, they were always following us to let us know we were not alone. 

The idea to have projects at the end of every module is great to solidify our knowledge and give us confidence that we can built awesome stuff, as well as start working on our portfolio and have something to tell recruiters when the time comes.

The teachers were very supportive and pushed us a lot during classes, in a way we had to face every challenge ahead of us, but knowing that we would have great people to support us. 

One of the main focus of the Bootcamp is to get us ready for the market. We had several different workshops about building our CVs and LinkedIn profiles, practicing for regular and technical interviews and great opportunities to visit companies and see offices and developer teams in action. It is something really interesting that hyped us to get out there and start applying for jobs!

Overall, those were 10 weeks that changed my life. It changed my way of facing problems, working in teams, dealing with pressure, organize myself and gave me many tools to work as a web developer, with technologies and languages that are up to date with what the market asks.

Because of my computer science and web dev background, I was a little skeptical of if a bootcamp would really be beneficial for me. BUT..... IT WAS THE BEST THING I COULD HAVE DONE. 

Ironhack's curriculum went hand-in-hand with the skills that job descriptions said I needed. I leanred the most relevant skills and technologies, and even more important, I learned how to APPLY these skills and actually built multiple projects on my own from them. This is all due to Ironhack's spot-on curriculum.

My instructor, Niko, was amazing. He was approachable, engaging, and above all, extremely helpful. He knew his shit. Any problem or question we had he could figure out. Niko doesn't just want you to learn the tech skills and the coding, he wants you to enjoy it. Nothing but great things to say about him.

I taught myself the basics of coding but breaking into the development world, as a self-taught Jr Developer, can be difficult.  My time at Ironhack taught me how to polish my portfolio, create a winning LinkedIn profile and how to approach finding a job in the “real world.” It worked great! I was busy getting my development environment set up for my new job as we were trying to finish our final projects. Needless to say it was rewarding. Tiring, but rewarding. My teacher was new to teaching so I will give him a lot of slack for understanding, teaching style, preparation and professionalism. Being able to self-teach and research documentation are both important skills so learning that is critical anyhow. I’m all about self improvement and learning new skills but when it comes down to it, it’s about getting work. Ironhack delivered. As a note: The hiring network tends to be local to the school so choose a location in a market that you want to work in. The career fair that Brito put together was unbelievable. There was a feeding-frenzy of local companies (20+) looking to hire in a well orchestrated event. The companies ranged the gamut from Citrix and Royal Caribbean to small startups. Ironhack campuses are all over the world so there is bound to be a place for you to enjoy, while you get your foot in the door of the dev world. Once you get your first dvelopment job it is much easier to find another position that is in another market. Bottom line, if you do your best, know how to learn and stay focused you will both enjoy your time and end up getting work.

247475,2019.0,True,Invaluable training UX/UI ,"I'm ready to start working as a UX / UI Designer.

Before beginning the Ironhack bootcamp, I knew precious little about UX and UI. I'd done some preliminary research on my own (thank you Coursera free online classes), and had muddled through the pre-work assignments. But I was basically a blank slate. I just wanted to learn, and begin my new career.

Ironhack gave me just that. This is an INTENSE program, make no mistake about it. I often arrived early and stayed late (sometimes until 10pm) - I think that made a difference. But the entire ambiance of Ironhack encouraged me to do my absolute best and give my all - so I did. And it really, really paid off.

The bootcamp starts a bit slow, with a couple theory-heavy weeks. However, everything always comes back to hands-on activities, which made it so the information you learned stayed in your head. The three projects we completed during the course of the bootcamp instilled what we'd learned again, and again, and again... 

I know there's still a lot to learn but I feel ready, ready in a way I would not have without Ironhack.

A couple tips:

- do the prework exercises. Seriously. If what you want is to get the most out of this bootcamp, this plays a HUGE role in hitting the ground running. Start off ahead of the game, not behind.

- don't be afraid of staying late. This is 8 weeks of hard work with a treasure at the end ... or it can be 8 weeks of slacking off and wasting time. It is entirely what you make it.

- Speak up in class. If you're confused, ask. You won't find teachers more open to questions and explanations than those at Ironhack.

- Share your experiences with your peers. Everyone has different specialities coming into the program. Use your peers - and welcome their questions as well!

246949,2018.0,True,Web Development Bootcamp (Full-Time),"About Me

I worked in a tech company where I started to do basic coding (VBA). It peaked my interest, so I began learning on my own by taking courses online. I realized I loved it and needed to quit my job to learn and deep dive in it. I chose Ironhack because of the very up to date courses they have (React, Node.js). 

The Bootcamp

It is very intense but also very fulfilling! You learn a lot from 9 to 7pm for 9 weeks and even more during project weeks. If you want to do it, be prepared to dedicate 100% in it. 

The bootcamp is seperated in 3 modules where you have 2 weeks of lessons+exercises and 1 week of project. It is crazy what you can achieve doing in some little time!

Teacher

Our teacher (Nizar) was great on all aspects: very knowledgeable with great teaching skills. It was a pleasure to be in his class and he is key in the bootcamp's success.

How they help you find a job?

At the end of the course, there is one week of meeting with companies of all kind : startup, consulting, bigger companies,etc. It is a great first touch with people from HR and developers in the companies and a good opportunity to show your projects and settle for a next interview. Ironhack helps well to prepare for this exercise (pitch practice, CV, etc). 
After the bootcamp

After Ironhack, finding a job is a full-time job. You need to code everyday to keep up with what you have learned and also apply to companies, take coding tests, etc. I applied to more than 10 companies and received 2 offers. I needed also to learn extra stuff we didn't have the time to learn in class (more related to general knowledge). 

I got hired 1 month after. Now starts a new challenge...

Conclusion

If you want to become a developer, start a company or just learn how to code and build applications, I strongly recommend Ironhack. But it also means hardworking and putting in a lot of energy during 9 weeks. But it is worth it!",2/20/2019,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

After studying psychology in Madrid, I decided to join this bootcamp in Miami to guide my life towards coding. I just wanted to find a job where I could code 24/7. And, thanks to Ironhack, I found it. It really works! It does not matter your background. Nevertheless, this is not magic. You have to work, A LOT. But that's a good part too!

It is a very complete bootcamp (I did the Full Time Web Development). They teach all the frontend basics (HTML, CSS and JS) and a lot of useful backend tools as well (Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose...). Also, they focus on React, that is the top 1 technology for frontend developers. 

About the staff, they are really amazing! Also the building is very cool; they have free beer (that is always a plus).

And, about my classmates, they were simply amazing. Being in a place for 10 hours a day with other people that share the same passion as me... that is priceless. 

So, in summary, Ironhack was one of the best experiences in my life. And, for sure, I would do it 100 times more if I could go back in time. And I can assure you that it works.

245995,2018.0,True,Awesome experience that helps you reach your goals in a timely manner,"Ironhack is something that changes you forever. I know it's hard to believe it but I'll do my best to explain my point of view.
I joined the full-time web development bootcamp to make a career change and it was a complete success: I went from being an engineer in another country to being a web developer in France in a matter of months!
I already had some knowledge about the taught topics prior to the bootcamp - that helped a lot as the course is really intense - but I still needed to consolidate my skills, acquire new ones and focus full-time on coding.
Not only did the bootcamp match those expectations, it also allowed me to land my dream job in little more than a month since graduation and it was a great investment for my future.

The course structure is great and each module focuses on a key aspect: it helps keeping things that simple. Also the technical stack is modern and highly valuable in the job market; you learn JavaScript and then use it in the backend and in the frontend; I think it's a smart choice and you can have so much more practice using always the same language.
If I had to highlight just one aspect of the bootcamp, it would be working on the 3 projects with other students: it really helped shaping us as developers and working with people with so diverse backgrounds - but with the same objective in life - was the greatest learning and working experience I've ever had.

Thanks to the topics covered during classes, which were always engaging and featuring what you really need to know, we were able to progress really quickly. The instructors and teaching assistants were extremely helpful and they always strove to make everything as smooth as possible for all the students.
Pair programming and exercises were a daily task and they allowed us to discover many topics and real life workflows in software development.
However a lot of effort is required to stay on track: only passion and commitment will drive you through the 9 weeks, so be sure about your objectives and dreams. If it checks for you, then you'll be a perfect match.

Also the career services were a great asset to me: I have learnt all you need in order to find the right job. We met several professionals in the sector during the whole course and the hiring fair was a blast! We met 14 companies (and some of us were hired by these very companies) in 2 days and it was the best training I could have asked for all the following interviews.

However I think that the course materials (written lessons and exercises) still need some improvement: as technologies evolve so quickly, it's hard to keep all the materials up to date. I don't think that this issue was a limiting factor for the bootcamp at all but I'd like to be honest about it. Also a major revision of the contents is in progress, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Moreover Ironhack keeps growing and evolving so it can only get better with time.

On a final note, the location and the people you meet there are amazing and you'll definitely want to stick around every day.
I hope this review can be useful to other people as I've tried to cover some of the topics that concerned me before joining the course. Finding out that such a short formation can bring so much value was the greatest surprise to me and I can't recommend it enough to people who are committed to changing their life.",2/8/2019,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

The experience i had certainly lived up tot the expectations i had based on the reviews. The campus is very nice - they provide food/coffe and all the necessities in dedicating 9 hours of your day 5 days a week there. The entire staff is very helpful and friendly. They also host networking/social events for students and people within the industry.

The ciririculum was on point as well - broken into three sections you learn everything including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, React, and various JavaScript libraries as well. They base the cirriculum on the current demands of companies who are hiring developers. Everything taught is relevant and practical.

247478,2018.0,True,Ironhack UX/UI Full-Time Miami,"I completed the UX/UI full-time program in Miami, FL in 2018.  

I did a lot of research, soul-searching, and self-teaching prior to the program.  In general, I had a positive experience with the program, but it has its share of pros and cons, and would benefit some more than others.

One of the best parts of the program is the classroom/workshop setting.  It was challenging to make much progress learning on my own despite having several friends who are already experienced UX designers.  The opportunity to connect with others who are also looking to break into the field, share ideas and learnings with them, and build a portfolio alongside them, was invaluable.  

The other is the job placement support.  At the end of the program, students are able to attend a hiring fair, which is like speed-dating with companies for jobs.  That in itself is an amazing opportunity for new designers.  Additionally, the outcomes manager, Brito, is a fantastic resource.  He is well-connected in the industry within South Florida and readily available to provide guidance with your job search.  That said, if you aren't looking for a job in South Florida, then I'm not so sure that Ironhack Miami would be the best program for you -- I would definitely recommend a program that is local to wherever you want to begin your career.

I also really appreciated the instructor, David Fast.  He is super knowledgeable and a great mentor.  I always got tons of insight whenever I had a 1:1 with him.  However, even in my class of only 11 students, this was a rare and often rushed occurrence.  In one instance, I was scheduled to meet with David last, and then my meeting never happened.  I wished the program were better structured to allow all students an equal opportunity to meet with their instructor regularly.

We also had a high churnover of TAs, and some were more helpful than others.

The curriculum could also be improved.  It was very high-level and theoretical -- a lot of content that we could have easily read about on our own.  Sometimes we just watched a YouTube video in class -- it boggles me that I am paying tuition, commuting to class, and spending class time to watch something I could have streamed at home.  I'd rather class time be spent on learning ""tricks of the trade"", things that would boost our skills and portfolio, things that we could readily transfer to the workplace.  Not things that I could easily Google or watch on YouTube.

The program manager, Jessica, is super personable and resourceful.  I appreciated her effort to provide opportunities for us to work with real companies for our final project.  Although I was very excited by the idea, ultimately I passed on the opportunity because the options available were limited and did not align with my learning or portfolio goals.  I know that some of my classmates had less than positive experiences working with these companies as well.  I think this is one area where, if improved, could make or break my recommendation of the program to others.

Finally, I don't think this program is for everyone.  I think either the interview process or the pre-work or both could be a bit more rigorous to set the right expectations.  As an example, if you were to ask the Web Dev students why they enrolled in their program, 99% of the time they would say it's because they love coding.  But if you asked the UX students the same question, you rarely hear that it's because they love design or product.  I think Ironhack could better screen prospective students and help them be sure that this is the right step for them.

246738,2018.0,True,I came in with no programming experience and got the job I wanted,"I was super impressed with the quality of this course. In short: very dedicated teachers, tons of support, weekly feedback surveys (where they actually take your feedback into account!), and lots of perks like networking and informational events, free beer, coffee, AWESOME people, etc. 


What I came in with:
My background is in Linguistics and Media Design (graphic and web design), and I decided to expand on my web design skills by actually learning how to build websites. I'd had a little experience coding in HTML and CSS before I started the course, but had no programming experience and only a little knowledge of how the internet works. The bootcamp really kicked my butt!! It felt the entire time that I was not keeping up as much as I'd have liked even though I was spending every waking hour learning as much as I could (i.e.: reviewing on the trains to and from the course, staying late to finish exercises, learning on the weekends...). I found that this was a pretty common feeling for a lot of people in the course, so you build great connections and help each other along the way. It was also essential that the teachers were so dedicated and supportive. It was my first introduction to how social coding could and should be.

In the end, even though a lot of the content was over my head throughout the course, I found that I'd learned enough to land the software developer job I'd had my eyes on since before the bootcamp. I'll be working in various languages, so showing my newly-gained knowledge of Javascript was enough to prove that I will be able to learn and work in other programming languages as well. 

Advice for anyone starting the course (especially if you have no programming experience like me!): 
Do yourself a favour and spend as much time as possible with the pre-work! I wish I'd spent more time with the Javascript part, it ended up being harder than I'd expected to wrap my head around the basics and I kind of ran out of time before the course started. I'd recommend even supplementing the pre-work with tutorials so that you really have a good grasp of the basics that are introduced there. There are lots of great tutorials online, free and paid, I learn really well with teamtreehouse.com for example.

It's been said a lot already, but it's totally true: work hard, don't give up, trust the process, and stay curious. It's ok to feel dumb, I promise!

246712,2018.0,True,UX/UI full time bootcamp (Miami),"I did a lot of research before joining Ironhack and while there are courses out there that teach similar content and/or the information is open sourced it is not being taught by a UX professional like David Fast. He presented the information in a clear manner and incorporated examples that resonated with the class. Most importantly at Ironhack you learn by doing, so it is not just a series of lectures but actual practical tips that you can take with you after you leave the course. For the most part I truly appreciated everything I learned from the curriculum, except for the crammed week of html/css which could have been structured better. However, the Ironhack team was open to feedback and provided some additional insights into a tool that was not originally included in the curriculum.

Regarding job assistance, Daniel Brito does a great job at preparing the upcoming graduates for the best career outcome. He is always one slack message away to answer questions and provide guidance. However, future students, let me be clear that Brito is there to provide guidance, not hold your hand until you find a job. It is up to the graduate to find opportunities and pursue them, but rest assured that Brito will be on your corner to help you close on that future opportunity.

246441,2018.0,True,AMAZING EXPERIENCE - Highly recommend Ironhack Miami!!,"I was a full-time student for the Full-Stack Web Development Cohort that graduated Dec 18, 2018. I had an AMAZING experience with Ironhack Miami. To give you an idea of how the class is structured, Week 1 and 2: FRONTEND: learn JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery, DOM Manipulation, Canvas. Week 3: Use those skills to create a game application, present at end of the week. Week 4 and 5: BACKEND: learn Node.js and Express, amongst numerous other topics. Week 6: Use those skills to create a full-stack application, present at the end of the week. Week 7: Learn React.js. Week 8 and 9: Create a Full-Stack MERN application, present at the end of Week 9. All non-project weeks are pretty much structured the same: Topic 1 lecture in the morning, then a paired lab. Topic 2 lecture in the afternoon, then a solo lab. The class was structured to have one lead instructor and 2 TAs. While this might sound similar to other bootcamps you've researched, I would like to point out the ""stand outs"" that make Ironhack Miami unique, which are the reasons why I ultimately chose it instead of other bootcamps I looked at:

1. Career Services: I can pretty much guarantee you will not find another bootcamp with a Career Services Manager like Daniel Brito. Not only is he incredibly well connected and great at creating partnerships with the school and local companies, but he is SO resourceful and involved. He typically lectured once a week to the class for an hour, and once you graduate the meetings get more frequent and more specialized to each student and their current job situation. I've been a working professional for 10 years and Brito still had great LinkedIn, Resume and Career advise to offer that I had never heard. While Brito is not the ONLY benefit to joining Ironhack, he is the most impactful benefit, hands down.

2. Pre-Work: This was the second most beneficial part of Ironhack for me. Other bootcamps I looked at did not require pre-work, but this was by far the difference that made me not completely lost when I started school. While the pre-work was VERY hard for me, as I was a career changer and not used to the terminology, the technologies or anything, the pre-work was SO helpful because it . forced me to familiarize myself with all of this BEFORE class started. If there had no been . pre-work, I don't think I would have been nearly as successful in the class as I was.

3. Building.co: this is the building Ironhack is located in. Some great features to note about it that were super helpful being a student- 24 hour access to the building, via secured access, unlimited free granola bars, unlimited free coffee (of ANY type), unlimited beer on draft starting at 5 PM, cool kitchen/outdoor space with picnic tables and corn hole to relax and take breaks. Building.co is a co-working space so there are a lot of tech people who have desks there to work, which is ideal for networking as a tech student. 

4. Guest speakers: tech speakers were brought in typically once every 2 weeks to talk to the class. This was helpful for networking purposes, but also for insight into the industry, what people do, what they are looking for, etc.

5. Lisa - the Growth Manger, was always great about hosting industry events at Building.co and in the area for students to attend with Miami tech industry people. This, again, was great for networking and more exposure to the industry.

6. The curriculum was well thought out and offers a lot of resources for you to have outside of class. If you pay attention in class, then go back and read all of the lectures, you will get the most benefits. Now that I am out of school and interviewing, I realize how many of the interview questions/vocab were in our lesson plans, I just never read them during class. READ THE LECTURES!!! They are super helpful!!

7. Lastly, the overall atmosphere created by the Ironhack Team is truly incredible. It is such a family/friend atmosphere where you work super hard, pull intense all nighters, but there is a sense of ""we are in this together"" and ""we are here for you"" which makes the whole process more fun and enjoyable.",1/15/2019,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack

The process ended and I won a partial scholarship to go to the UX / UI course. After this I started going to events, everyone was super inviting and they hosted a lot of these events that were really interesting. 

The course is 2 months intensive bootcamp, took me about 8 months to prepare for this, save some money because working through the camp is really hard. Have to say I was blown away. The content, classes, staff, everything is up there. 

The teacher is David Fast and he is incredible. He's a humble guy with a lot to offer. He knows that he doesn't know all the answers, and if he doesn't he will surely get back to you with the answer. The process they teach is the process many up to date companies are using and the tools they teach are what you will be using in the job market. 

Jessica, who is the program manager, is super reachable, she is mostly in and always has the time to meet you if you have the need.

After finishing all of the program they assist you on getting a job, from the how to the tracking and even putting a good word for you in companies all around South Florida. Daniel Brito is in charge of this, and if you are in the South Florida tech ecosystem you probably know him, if not, then everybody else does. He is greatly connected and does a great job in helping every student in this important task.

246415,2018.0,True,Ironhack is more than just coding,"Once upon a time I saw a message on Kleiderkreisel. Kleiderkreisel wants to support women in tech and there is an opportunity to get a scholarship. To apply was my best decision, I got the full scholarship.

Ironhack is the best place to learn clean coding. I enjoyed every second there. Much practice, interesting tasks and relevant content: that's what you get. But Ironhack is more than just coding. You become part of Iron-family there and get huge network of tech-interested people. We had many tech events and free time activities: you never get bored at Ironhack. Ironhack staff is very friendly, always reacts to feedback and helps wherever they can to make you experience there unforgettable and useful.

Some advices for new ironhackers: use the opportunity of networking, it's very valuable. Don't panic if you feel lost at the begin, it will get better! And of course, you get what you put into it, so come with motivation and passion!

244988,2018.0,True,Great Choice for those who work hard,"I attended Ironhack Full time WebDev course in 2018.
I was unhappy at my previous Career and began a research to explore other options. I looked into programming and all the job opportunities that comes with it. I started to learn by myself, but reached a point where i was not making any progress and was not able to find a job.
As a Career changer, i needed to take the fastest train towards employment and started reading about Bootcamps. I decided that it was what i needed. I visited several other Bootcamps, reviewed prices, curriculum and outcomes. Ironhack seemed to be the best of all, specially after visiting the Miami Campus. 

Compared to the other bootcamps i visited , Ironhack was by far the most impressive. With a great space, friendly people and really good energy from students and employees.
I met the Admissions Manager, and he was incredibly friendly and attentive, answered all my questions and guided me through the process of making the final decision.
Before being able to enroll, you need to pass a in-person coding Challenge that is fairly easy, if you study online prior to the challenge. I passed the test and started the bootcamp.

The main Instructor was very knowledgeable and the classes are very fast paced, so you really have to dedicate yourself to it if you want to actually learn and make it through.

The TA's are very helpful with your process of learning and understanding the problems that you will face. (usually the TA's are former students that didn't find a job and start working with Ironhack while looking for more opportunities; Pretty awesome help, feels like a safety net for some people).

The Curriculum is packed with huge amounts of information and you need to apply yourself to learn more everyday. Again, i cant stress this enough, Ironhack is an INCREDIBLE place to learn and grow as a professional, but if you dont apply yourself, i dont think its gonna work.

At the end of the Cohort, i had 3 big projects to show to possible employers with the most required technologies in the job market right now. The Job Placement experience has been hard BUT the Manager that takes care of it is incredibly helpful and goes above and beyond to give you the best opportunities at all times (at least thats how i feel about it). 
Even though it might seem strange to be able to learn so much in so little time, The Ironhack experience was one of the toughest and most rewarding things i did in my life and i truly believe that i chose the best bootcamp possible; Not only on the Student/Curriculum perspective , but also with all the networking, interview preparation and real world experiences that they train their students for.

245915,2018.0,True,Skeptic turned juice-drinker: Ironhack helped change me solidify my career &amp; passion,"I was a solid skeptic coming into the course and, of course, wanted that ""bang for my buck"", but I could not have been happier with my experience. In short, I achieved every goal I had coming into the course and I got an even richer experience coming out of it. The bootcamp helped me solidify my UX/UI skills & interests while giving me the platform (and confidence) to pursue UX/UI design in a more than  successful manner. Most importantly, the culture that they provided (from admin to instructors to TA) was an invaluable asset to the entire experience. I thought some reviews were corny when they mentioned a ""family-like vibe"" before I entered the course, but no joke, it organically came about that way and was the magic to the whole thing. I've met some truly special people and developed meaningful connections.

I felt a little lost in what I wanted to do before I came in to the course (having exhausted all kind of jobs in all kinds of industries) and always felt stuck in my potential, but the bootcamp changed my life and gave me back my confidence in my personal & professional skills while giving me the networks & resources needed to really pursue a career and not just a job. It was intense, but so worth every penny & minute spent. Also keep in mind that the course is here to help you, NOT do it all for you. This is an important read: bit.ly/ironhackuxui

Pros:
- Instructor (X1000): Nevan made the entire difference because of his experience & character. The material was so digestible and interesting. His direction & guidance was priceless.
- Teacher assistants: telling of the course & instructor to have these individuals as the TA. They were relatable, but still way more knowledgeable to help us along the way
- constant events: Ironhack constantly holds professional events, grabbing the industry and its networks in through the doors. The topics are always relevant & networking it great
- material & projects: what can I say? I'm super proud to have the projects on my portfolio and have received delightful feedback from industry professionals on the scope of the project 
- tuition well spent (investing back in the students): You're always going to feel like you're spending a lot on whichever bootcamp you sign up for, but I always felt like I got more than what I expected. They often will have events that have free snacks & beverages (free filtered water!!!) for the students and you can tell that part of the tuition is really kept for the students
- friendly atmosphere: any staff member is always helpful & cheery. It was never stiff walking into the office or talking to at admin staff
- location: you're in the center of the tech neighborhoods (10 min walk away from the tech hub in BCN) and in the middle of really great coffee shops

However, from the first day of class, my experience has been even better than expected. The WebDev course is really intense, but you can feel that there has been so much thought gone into creating the classes and defining each and every day. You will be asked to give feedback frequently, but you will understand why. Based on the feedback of all previous classes, this course has been fine-tuned to perfection over the years. If you put your mind to it and really want to jumpstart learning to code, this is the right course for you. The things you will be able to do after just 9 weeks (even after just the first week), is exactly what you need to get started in this industry. The teachers and assistants are amazing, not just in class, but also before and after. The entire staff really cares about creating the best learning environment up to a point that it doesn't feel like school anymore, but more like a second home. The course is without a question expensive (although also by far not the most expensive out there), but it's worth every cent. This is an investment that will pay back and be refinanced in the first couple of weeks. If you are interested in coding and want to work in this field, apply now.

Brito is the ""Placements Manager"" and I've yet to see anyone more passionate about matching students with carreers. Brito is often found running around the school creating/maintaining contacts for carreer fairs to ensure every student has the maximum chance of successful job placement. He is a core component to student success with unmatched connections in the Miami tech industry and is highly regarded and respected. Brito always maintains a level of approachbility and availablity and is 100% committed to matching up students with the correct potential employers. Students normally interact with Brito near graduation time as he interviews every student and forms a relationship and pairs student traits to the best matching employers.

The curriculum is extremely up to date. We learned the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node). We worked on 3 portfolio projects (a videogame, a full stack app with a partner, and a full stack app in React on our own).  Our main teacher Hector Bliss has worked with Google, and is a fantastic communicator and coder (he's quite a funny personality too). The other TA's were very helpful and knowledgeable as well.  

The pace was definitely more intense than I expected. Even having a  Computer Science minor in university I still felt challenged by the material (which I loved!). You have to be ready to devote all your energy to this (up to 10hrs a day). However, this is what makes the experience so valuable.

The management team is super professional. Julian (the regional manager) is a native of Silicon Valley and has worked with many startups when he served as Global Entrepreneur Program manager at IBM.  Anahí was on top of every situation and always willing to help and listen to us. The program is very well organized.  

I feel like there is a shortage of React developers here in Mexico, so job opportunities are abundant now.  I validated that this week in our Hiring Week, having over 20 interviews with top notch startups and Fortune 500 companies.

We were also the first cohort to learn React.js as a front end programming language and they did a fairly good job adapting the new curriculum on the fly considering how new teaching the language was.

Ironhack was something I grew to look forward to every morning, despite my hour long commute.

245063,2018.0,True,My Ironhack Experience,"About Me

I worked in IT, and did some coding, but nothing past basic JavaScript. It peaked my interest, so I began learning on my own by taking courses online. I realized I needed to go about learning in a different way. I researched courses/boot camps and ran into Ironhack and decided to dive in and take it’s Full-Time Web Dev course after coming across great reviews/ratings.

Expectations and Course Run Down

Be ready to learn, because you’re going to learn a lot. It's a full time 9-5pm every day for 9 weeks (not including the after hours you want to put in as well) it's no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into IronHack. You learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week - repeat again 2 more times after that. Come in prepared to learn, take in all the material, and be willing to put in the work.

Help During Course Work / Curriculum (TA’s and Teacher)

The instructor for our Cohort (Nick) was very knowledgeable. The only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course, so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too. Besides that, he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject, I would not have learned as much as I did. As for the teaching assistants, all three of them were amazing (Sandra, Marcos, Ian). They were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all Ironhack graduates as well. It was extremely helpful having dedicated TA's who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they WANT to help. There's more than enough help to go around, just make sure to ASK for it when you need it and you won't fall behind.

The coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days, our instructor Nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out. During the course this was one of my top issues, the curriculum for sure needed an update, but from what I have seen after my time there they are (or already have) taken the steps necessary to do so. Which means they take your feedback seriously and won't brush your input aside.

Rest of Ironhack Staff

Since the first day I applied and even now the staff at Ironhack hasn’t missed a beat. They have been helpful and there for me with any questions I had. They have an idea as to what they want to do with the course, and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible. It doesn’t matter who you try to contact, the owner, down to the TA’s, they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them.

Hiring Fair Prep

From the first week at Ironhack, you become well acquainted with a man named Brito. Take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job. He walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you, such as building your resume, creating your LinkedIn, and lets you know about networking events to attend. He constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly. Brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him. Along with all this prep work, you are also creating your portfolio during the course. You create 3 projects (on your own or in a small group) which showcase everything you've learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio.

Hiring Fair Event

At the end of the course, Brito arranges companies to come to Ironhack and sit down with you for interviews. This is a valuable introduction for your first interviews. Eventually, you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn't do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them. Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously, definitely come prepared to nail them during the event - people DO get hired out of these. This is what you prepare for, and it helps to prepare for future interviews.

Post Ironhack Experience

After Ironhack, finding a job (if that is what you are there for) is the next battle. Brito is there with you every step of the way. He holds placements help meetings at Ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have. He guides you and reminds you that you must KEEP CODING and KEEP APPLYING. If you slack off on those two steps, the job hunt instantly becomes much harder.  Take your LinkedIn, networking, and resume seriously. Do little projects on your own after the cohort, and make sure your JavaScript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on HackerRank/Codewars because they will help with the technical interviews.

I did not get hired immediately after Ironhack. I applied to around 300+ jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in-person interviews. I got hired 3 and a half months after. I never stopped coding, I never stopped applying and I always kept in touch with Brito. This process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp, but do not quit.

Conclusion

Yes - you learn a lot at Ironhack and are given great guidance, but no they will not hand you a job. You get everything you need from them and now it’s up to you to put in the work and land it. They are there with you every step of the way. I would 100% do it again, I put my life on hold, invested in myself, pushed through and changed my career into something I felt would be more fulfilling. So far it hasn’t disappointed one bit. Not only do you learn a lot at Ironhack, but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community.

244262,2018.0,True,Amazing learning experience!,"I recently completed the part-time Web Development course, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their skills or technological knowledge base. I had an all-around wonderful learning experience. You don't need to have much computer knowledge going into it, because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up. My class had 3 exceptional TA's, Manuel, Colby, and Adrian, who constantly were able to provide assistance when I ran into trouble, had bugs, or just got lost. They were always nice, patient, and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure I really understood deeply what we were learning, including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail. I was really impressed with -and grateful for- each of them. 

I was also very impressed with the professor, Alan. He is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching. Always patient, courteous, and welcoming of questions, feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems. What really impressed me most about Alan, is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges, to prepare us to think like computer scientists, and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview, and explain the different ways to approach the problems, and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management. It was well beyond what I expected from a web development course, and I found these lessons particularly rewarding. Alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution. *Protip* Always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents, I noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding. If he gives you the marker, get up there and give it your best effort. Go home and research the concepts further. JUST DO IT!  Get a whiteboard, for your house, and write important concepts, objectives, goals, and problem examples from class. This will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis. You will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews, and they're abstract, and frustrating if you are not prepared.

After graduation, you'll be counseled by Brito, your career counselor, who is also a very cool, down-to-earth and knowledgeable person. He has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process, how to construct your resume, and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers. I am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive, helpful, and make sure you land a good starting job, well after graduation. 

Looking back I am extremely thankful to Ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class. Everyone from my classmates to the teachers, to the teacher's assistants, to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with. 

Also, I was blown away by the Ux/UI students. We (the web dev class) got a chance to work with them in the hackathon (which was a totally awesome experience) and they were very impressive. I legitimately wish I could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology, creativity, and organized thought processes. They were amazing. I loved working with them.

I attended the Web Development Bootcamp in Berlin in July 2018 and it was not only a journey into coding languages, but even an inner journey.
Because when you are stuck on something, you need to find the way and the resources (inside and ouside yourself) to go out of it. And Ironhack team helps you in this effort.

Berlin Lead Teacher, Maxence, is a very knowledgeable coder and has many years of experience in the industry. His teaching style tends to make concepts easy to understand, providing lots of example and different ways to achieve the goals for almost every coding task.

But Ironhack is not only coding. Staff and teachers takes care of you all along the course and your classmates become friends and the ones who share your frustration, happiness and some nice events like week-end parties!

Ironhack provides also weekly talks from real coders, CTO, project managers from local startups and bigger companies, or from freelancers. And the final career week (scheduled meetings with companies that are hiring) is a great opportunity to get in touch with real companies and start looking for a job.

You start each day blind, without any knowledge of how it'll end. You can be at the top of the roller coaster or in free fall, afraid for what's next. It's a must have adventure, that's for sure, there's no living the same experience anywhere else. That feeling of self-development you get after you finish Ironhack and see the HUGE adventure you've just went through and it's results. Everyone should do it.

It's like a little sect you don't want to get out of, even though you've just finished a course there is always something more to do, to learn, some new student to help and guide into his adventure. Ironhack is forever.

A few weeks ago I decided to do the web development bootcamp at Ironhack, I had no prior experience in programming as I worked in admin and logistics. Having finished the course, I know programming is what I want to do and I want to keep learning about all types of technologies.

¿What did I do during these 9 weeks? Coding, coding, coding. It could sound boring but it was far from it. When you do something you like, you don’t mind putting in the hard work. Here you learn many technologies from day one, and even though it’s very difficult d and very intense, the result is worth it: my colleagues because friends, the staff is always there to help you even outside their working hours and, most of all, I know have the tools to become a junior programmer.

239012,2018.0,True,My steps in Ironhack,"It is curious how the destiny of each one is woven based on the decisions that one takes in life, good or bad, and lead us to follow paths of success or failure that in the end will always be lessons that help us to form ourselves as beings human beings, pieces or enclaves in a society. In my particular case, immigrant and with more than 17 years previous working in the commercial area in Sales of Technology, having made the decision to invest in the training of Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp in Ironhack has meant a turning point in my career. And for me it has been precisely that: an investment in the future.

When I decided that I wanted to return to the roots of my studies (I'm an Computer Engineer) after so many years without writing a line of code, concerned only about selling products that in some cases I did not understand what they do, I started a search for a study system that I could obtain the necessary knowledge to go in search of a job in what many years ago was my livelihood and why not, my satisfaction. For this I enrolled in some basic PHP / Javascript courses with MySQL Database and an additional Oracle Database 12c course. But they were just that: basic courses. They gave me an aerial view of what Web development is in these times but they did not go deep enough to feel safe to go after a job in the development area.
And as in social networks there is nothing hidden (we know how the algorithms that make product suggestions work, learning our tastes and posting notices of topics that we have touched or visited previously) I saw in one of these networks, an advertising of a Full Stack Web training that caught my attention because of its content. It was not a simple computer course like other ones in the market. It was really a formal study where in two and a half months a good part of the tools, frameworks, methodologies, etc., would be covered for the development of Web applications. It described how we are going to go, from the basics to making applications that from a user's point of view were as complex as making calls to API's RestFUL of spatial geolocation to create technology trending Web applications. A walk through HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, NodeJS, Express, Ajax, Axios, Angular all this with MongoDB Database, alternating with continuous development tools such as GIT and project planning as Trello. I found it a challenge and as I said initially, an investment for my return to the area that brought me so much satisfaction. Of course, I did an exhaustive search of trainings of this type in Madrid to make a comparative table and I finally decided on Ironhack because it seemed to me the most complete of all the training I saw, in addition to the fact that I am very learning in person, to be near the instructor and surrounded by people who could ask for help to clarify doubts if that were the case. For this reason, I proceeded to write via email to the contact person that appeared in the promotion. The answer was immediate and I started the procedures to be able to register for the FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOT CAMP - FULL TIME JUNE 2018 training. Here the journey began.

Important to clarify that I did not have the money to do this training but here is another advantage that immediately allowed me to strengthen my decision. At Ironhack, they have two financial support institutions that could finance the training with the necessary flexibility to cover the costs. What more could I ask for!

Now, I went through a series of questions and qualification interviews to validate if I had the capacity to do this training and that they did not represent a problem for me to enter since I had the advantage of having studied Computer Engineering 25 years ago and something was left of the programmatic thinking. I went immediately to the Pre-Work, a series of exercises and activities to soak students with certain basic knowledge and thus start from the first day to learn everything necessary to carry these two and a half months of intensive training. And that's what it is, that's why the denomination of ""Boot Camp"". Let's understand the concept. Here you come to work. And work hard. Every day, from Monday to Friday and including several weekends, is hard work. Beginning with the fact that two exercises (or projects) are done daily. One in the form of pair-programming, which gives us the notion of what it is to work with a team, and the other project you work individually. And some of these exercises tend to be extensive which makes it difficult to finish without staying up late (my personal recommendation for those who register: do not get up late, seek to do what possible but put a limit on working hours because fatigue accumulates day after day and every day you will see important matter that requires attention and all the senses in it). And every two weeks there will be a large project (three in total) where you can practice what you have learned in the previous weeks. For this reason, if you feel that some of the concepts were not well learned, calm that in each project will have the opportunity to resume and apply these concepts.

It is true that many concepts are seen, but the learning methodology, being able to use continuous development tools such as GIT, working as a team in various exercises or projects, is basically what you face in real work environments. And for that they prepare you.

Another important point to note is the support and ongoing advice on human resources issues, where you will have sessions to improve your Linkedin profile (or create it for those who have not registered) and your résumé. As an anecdote, just changing some things in my profile, I got the first day two contacts of people looking for Web developers from England. These consultancies are worth their weight in gold and should be used as much as they are part of the Ironhack program that seeks to position their students in the labour market. And believe me, its work.

Finally, after two months and a week of continuous learning, Ironhack organizes a week called the ""hiring week"" where they invite a group of companies that will be validating your projects and interviewing students for possible work places to be filled with Boot Camp students. It is time to show your talents and you have a high chance of getting a job related to the topics seen. Particularly I had already gotten a job before this week so I did not attend and yet you have saved the opportunity to attend some future process if you wish.

Finally, it must be understood that Ironhack, besides being a learning academy, is also a community. A community where events are constantly being published where you can review trends, new technologies or simply have an invitation to spend a Friday evening with friends with some beers. As a member of this community you can call to give a talk to new students about your experience, how to handle the stress of the activities, or simply accompany a new student under the figure of ""buddy"" in order to listen and advise how to carry The Boot Camp to these new members.

Ironhack has been an experience, an investment that has paid off and allowed me to reinsert myself into the technical world, something that fills me with satisfaction. It was a total good experience in which a made a good friends and contacts in a web partners that for sure, is going to be maintained for years.

245046,2018.0,True,The Last of Our Stack: MEAN Web Dev,"I've recently finished the MEAN stack 9-week bootcamp in Madrid with no previous coding experience and, let me say, what a blast! There are certain things I think they don't make more of an emphasis when you sign up for the full time bootcamp, 90% of which can boil down the the following warning: it's really intense. Drop-everything-else-you're-doing intense. Self-doubt-inducing intense. This worked in my favor which is why you don't see this listed as a con but that can be unhelpful for people that are making plans to continue working/studying or that simply appreciate or thrive in a slower-paced learning environment.  

 

Pros

The team, both educational and administrative, is really fun to be around and work to make sure you get that family vibe. Sometimes it feels borderline cult-like but the social outcome is nice. 
The student environment I found very enriching specifically because of the variety of backgrounds found among us. Our group had a number of people with experience and a few with none and which made for a great learning experience.
Support in the job search. Even when it's not the outcomes manager posting, there's a thread in the Slack with offers coming in at all times.

Cons

Not the world's most organized or punctual bunch. 
We didn't touch React, which we were asked about during our hiring week so I felt that was a massive disservice to us (but did, strangely enough, have the time for an introduction to Docker the day before the presentation of our last projects). This has since been changed in the curriculum but I'm still salty about it.",9/17/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack

I graduated from Odontology and worked as a dentist for a few years and even though it’s a great career, it got to a point where I wasn’t motivated anymore and I wanted to do something I was truly passionate about.

I’ve always liked technology and I saw the opportunity of learning web development in a very short period of time to see if I would like it. The bootcamp requieres a lot of hard work and if you don’t have prior programming experience each day is a challenge with a big learning curve. You work hard and have daily frustrations, but it is completely worth it. I’m very happy to have done it and I truly believe anyone can learn to program.

It would be great for me, to be able to unite the best of both worlds, Dentistry and Technology.

244301,2018.0,True,Full Stack Web Development - April - June 2018,"In this review, I aim to provide an honest account of my experiences as a student in Ironhack’s April - June 2018 cohort in Miami, FL. I chose to wait until after I had been out of the course and in a job for a while before reflecting on my experience and evaluating how well Ironhack prepared me for what I am currently doing.
 
My Ironhack Experience:
 
Application:
    I did a great deal of research within a small period of time before applying, going through the interview process and leaving my previous employer to join Ironhack. Like many other students, I decided on Ironhack because of the curriculum, the reputation of Brito as an Outcomes Manager, and the reputation of their lead instructor Nizar, however, when the cohort started I learned that we would have a new instructor, Nick, an Ironhack graduate. When I registered for this course many of my classmates and I was under the impression that Nizar would be our teacher who I understood was someone with years of real world experience and was the primary reason for all the great reviews about Ironhack.
I decided about three weeks before the cohort started to join in April which was just enough time before it was too late. The coding challenges and pre-work used the same online portal which contained their learning modules. Once I got the learning material I had to get them done within the one week I had before the cohort started so I worked that week on the online material full time to get ready for the first week. I cannot stress how important it is for you to really focus on the pre-work and understand the meaning behind what it is that you are going to be learning and do further research when necessary. If at any point you find yourself questioning whether or not this is for you, take time away from the problems you are having and come back to it with a fresh perspective. This is a habit you should try to incorporate in your learning as you are working with abstract concepts you haven’t been exposed to yet or are re-learning. It's really easy to get frustrated when you are first starting out which causes some students to drop out of the cohort before it really has time to start.
 
Curriculum / Lectures / Projects:
    The first week is spent developing a browser game which when I initially signed up sounded like a lot of fun, and at times it was, however, I do not feel that it fits the curriculum when considering how much better the time could be spent. I would recommend spending more time to focus on the fundamentals, working collaboratively (git-flow), and more time on coding challenges/interview prep.
    Many of the examples within the modules when learning these new concepts were essentially the same which made it harder to grasp some of the concepts we were going over. A large portion of information, direction, and dependencies for the labs and lectures were out of date or not set up properly. Some learning modules were skipped altogether and a lot of time was wasted on bugs that can be avoided if the lecture notes and labs were updated or reviewed by the instructor before the lecture for the day began. I was also having a hard time grasping these concepts when I was encouraged to just copy paste what was in the modules to do my labs and my projects instead of thinking it though.
    There was a sudden change the day before the final project weeks started where our cohort was preparing to put together their individual projects for our personal portfolios and then it was announced that we would be working in groups for the last project. We were not told from the beginning that we were to take into consideration that we would be working on the final project in pairs or groups of three. We were never taught best practices dealing with version control and how to go about working with multiple people on a project at the same time. The brief overview that we had on collaborative git practices lasted less than 30 minutes and didn't even cover how to deal with merge conflicts or common errors that would come up in collaborative scenarios.
    Our instructor Nick was gone during the second to last week which was one of the most important weeks of our cohort. The majority of people in the course have been stuck on the same issue which dealt with having a login session persist across views in Angular. The only example we have to go off of was incomplete because of all of the bugs we ran into the week before Nick left and the TA’s were not able to figure out how to resolve the issue. If the Ironhack staff knew that he was going to be out during this important week that should have arranged for a substitute or have prepared the TAs to take over the curriculum for the week. The TAs would only be able to help to a certain extent until they are unsure of how to proceed due to their lack of experience and we're left to wait in line to be assisted by Nick, however that week we did not have the option so there was a great deal of lost time. My group members and I should not have been feeling the need to pay by the minute on tutoring websites like Hackhands and to make up for the lack of education we had received to get our project done in time.
 
Learning Environment:
    I can’t speak for other cohorts, but the April 2018 cohort was fantastic. Everyone got along really well and we all still keep in touch with one another regularly post-graduation. Building.co is a fantastic workspace. Free beer, coffee, fruit, snacks, and there are plenty of good options for eating in the area. My only criticism is that Building.co can get a bit cramped at times as far as private areas for studying and meetings go, but that’s expected considering it’s a co-working space.  The TAs were incredibly helpful throughout the cohort. Shoutout to Sandra for always staying far later than she needed to help us with our projects throughout the cohort. I’m sure I speak for all of my classmates when I say that we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did without the support of the TAs. Brito also brought in some great guest speakers and organized a panel of alumni to come to talk to us about their post-graduate experiences.
 
Career Week:
    Career Week is the most important week you will at Ironhack. The content during this week is crucial to your job search and should be followed to the letter if you plan on getting hired and will be applicable beyond entry-level job searches. If you haven’t heard of or really considered Career Week as a selling point for your investment in an experience at Ironhack I would highly encourage you to reconsider and look at some of the companies that Ironhack is partnered with and the companies that graduates like myself are currently working at.
Career week is a fantastic opportunity where companies come to Ironhack in order to interview graduates in a ""speed dating” fashion. You get to meet with many companies, and if you are inexperienced with interviewing like I was at the time, it may help you to get over the nervousness of being in an interview. If you've read any of the other reviews on this site or other sites about Ironhack Miami I'm sure that you have read or heard the name Daniel Brito or Brito for short. Brito is the Outcomes Manager, and it is his responsibility to work towards partnerships with companies and bring them in to meet potential graduates as candidates for entry-level jobs. He’s one of the most connected people in the Miami tech scene and has your best interests in mind. Ironhack would not be the same without his efforts. He was one of the most supportive people throughout the entire cohort and has continued to help me after graduation and reach out to me to see how my new job is going. 
 
Post-Graduation / Job Search:
    I received my job offer from CareCloud, one of the companies that came to our hiring fair, about a month and a half after the cohort ended. However, do not place all your bets on getting a job from one of the companies that come to career week, this would be a huge mistake. Brito will be there every step of your job search from interview to offer letter as long as you follow the guidelines and strategies that he goes into detail about throughout the week. Never stop coding during your search, it’s important to keep your committing to new projects and continuing your learning so that you have something to show employers what you’ve been doing with your time since graduation. If you lose your motivation to teach yourself after the cohort is over you’re going to have a very hard time finding a good job.
 
Overall, I would recommend Ironhack to someone looking to make a career change, however, I would also like to see many things improved as it continues to grow. I felt that my cohort was disorganized and that there was a serious lack of curriculum preparation. I did not see efforts made to improve the quality of our experience throughout the cohort's duration although we were giving them feedback every few weeks. I was not satisfied with how my education at Ironhack turned out at the time of graduation. I went through career week and then graduated lacking the confidence in my skill set necessary to get through a real technical interview. The weeks following graduation I spent all my time working on projects and learning React which I knew would help me stand out more when looking for a job while reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals and applying to jobs using Brito's advice.
 
I am currently writing up an accompanying article for this review that I hope will fill in any other gaps for those who are looking into or graduating from Ironhack and boot camps like it which will include helpful resources that I used before, during and after my boot camp experience that helped me get my new job at CareCloud.

240917,2018.0,True,"Crazy steep learning curve, highly motivated &amp; qualified teachers, a lot of fun","I took the Ironhack bootcamp in between working as a Business Development Manager in the Berlin startup ecosystem and starting a Master's degree in Data Science. My objective was to understand software architecture in order to work as a Product Manager, how web apps are created from scratch and to try out potentially moving fully to a job in software engineering. My experience with Ironhack was absolutely fantastic and I would do it again, anytime. 

I will answer the questions I had when picking a bootcamp and hope this can help any future student. 

Why not do an online course ? 
What I found very special with Ironhack was how teachers and peers were an amazing motivation, something you don't get online. The teachers were available  every day until 10 pm and even on weekends, which I found incredible, every time with a smile on their face. The teaching team also spend significant time on team building and allowing the students to get to know each other with after school events, cooking sessions, giving the whole experience a very personal touch. They were extremely helpful with every question I ever had, no matter how basic. Studying with a cohort of students and sharing a physical classroom made it much easier for me to keep it up even during hard days where the learning felt like a lot of work. 

Whats the niveau of the course and how much time do I need to spend during the course? 
I personally had some previous coding experience (Python and C++, but six years before the time of the course) and no idea about front end. There is elaborate pre-work distributed by Ironhack before the start of the physical course that allows you to prepare yourself if you feel insecure about being ready. I did not spend a lot of time on it and found that we were ""caught up onto the same level"" within the first days of the bootcamp. The course is intense and requires you to spend some long evenings in class, however, it is clear that everyone learns for themselves and teachers are supportive no matter what effort you make - if you keep it low for two days, you will not punished with a frown or less attention. Teachers continuously checked up on the students level of understanding and offered additional courses and catch-up sessions whenever needed. In general it does feel like the whole group goes from ""0 to 100"" in the two month, coding-wise. 

Does it make you job ready ?
Totally. I personally was not looking for employment after the bootcamp as I was starting a Master's degree, but nevertheless talked to many CTOs, companies etc in the course of the bootcamp and realized how ""good"" you get at Ironhack. Talking to my peers and seeing where (and how quickly) they got hired gives me the confidence to say, it makes you absolutely job ready.",9/9/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

244582,2018.0,True,The Perfect Start in my Career!,"I just finished the Ironhack Full time Web development Bootcamp in Berlin where I learned to code real world applications using the MERN Stack. In those 9 intense weeks we learned everything we need to know in order to get employed as a Junior Developer. The Bootcamp was very intense, especially the first 2 weeks but it was always fun to learn and I became very close with the other students, even though they were decades older than me :) (I am currently 18).  We usually all stayed in class from 9am to 8pm or sometimes even later to catch up on old lessons or exercises. The course material is very good and we have live long access to it. The career services Ironhack offers are also very helpful. A lot of the students got employed from one of Ironhacks Partners. Sometimes there were organizational problems but nothing major. 

Summarized the Bootcamp was one of the greatest decisions of my life. I can start my career as a developer right away, even though I don't have a College degree or an apprenticeship diploma. I also have the feeling I learned much more than just coding. My english and my interview skills for example improved a lot!

244528,2018.0,True,THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER!!!,"For perspective: I enrolled in the full-time web development boot camp after receiving an Uber scholarship award. I graduated from Ironhack in June 2018 and went on to find a job three months later in early September. 

When I first started the course, I had no previous experience in coding, was barely comfortable with a Mac (yes, you read that correctly), and I was WORKING (part-time). If you can avoid working, please do, because this course WILL require time outside of the 400 hours you are put through, and then some.

I was amazed by how knowledgeable our instructor (Nick) and TA's were (I'm talking about you Sandra and Marcos!) as well as the sense of community that is evident from the day you first walk in. Aside from the facts that my cohort missed out on Nizar and that we constantly had to skip over lessons just due to the pace at which we had to learn, I can honestly say that everything is set up for you to succeed. The curriculum is constantly changing with the latest and greatest so that's a huge plus too.

This will be hard. It will challenge you, you'll learn something new every day, and you'll have to put in a lot of work and effort outside of the classroom. But it will be worth it.

I'll end with a final note on my experience during the job hunt and the awesomeness of Daniel Brito (the Outcomes Manager). Don't you dare go ghost on Brito during your job hunt. He's your wing-man, your therapist, your cheerleader on the sidelines and more -as long as you Slack him first. It took me three months after graduating (and A LOT of rejection) to land the job I'll be starting in a few weeks. Don't be afraid to hear no. Keep trying, and, if you're trying to land a web dev role, KEEP CODING. And even if you're not, KEEP LEARNING. Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to jobs - there are other roles willing to pay you for the skills you acquired - my current role doesn't require coding, but the skill helped me land it. Brito was there throughout the entire process, constantly keeping track of my progress, and rooting for me the entire time. 

I'm grateful to have gone through this experience because it really did change my life. I've made friendships that'll last me a lifetime and the return on my investment was better than I could've imagined.",9/6/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

That's why I decided to attend the UX/UI design bootcamp in Ironhack Paris, after looking for different learning options online, and getting recommendations from friends.

During this bootcamp, you will learn the full UX/UI design process, mixing theory and actual case studies to apply your knowledge. For your final project, you will work with a real company on an actual brief (in my case a start up specialised in car logistics), which is super interesting, and gives you a sneak peek of your future professional life as a UX/UI designer.
It is definitely an intense program, where you have to assimilate lots of knowledge in a limited amount of time. You won't be alone though: my other fellow students were really supportive of each other, and the teachers are always there to help you, challenge you in every decision you make, to push you out of your comfort zone.

The course covers a wide range of topics and gives you all the tools needed to start your career as a junior developer, however to get the best out of the course, it’s important to be fully invested and to know what outcomes you want from your bootcamp.

- the negatives –
There is a big importance on team building within the class and with the other cohorts happening at the same time, but at times this can feel a bit forced. If you’re not very social, this can be tiring.

Scheduling/organization seems to be a bit of an issue. Some examples: having (somewhat required) career prep sessions or activities during our lunch breaks, never receiving reinforcement lessons, catching up on courses during our project weeks, etc. This probably depends a lot of the cohort and the other factors, but some things just seemed last second and/or badly timed.

+ the positives +
The materials are good, and the staff is nice, but the stand out was our instructor, Nizar. He is truly an excellent teacher; enthusiastic and very clear in his manner of explaining (simple and complex) concepts. I could not have asked for a better instructor for the course.

The career services were also super helpful. The Outcomes Manager, Dina, helped us with our resumes, rebranding, and explaining our background to recruiters. We got to meet with many companies, as well as recruitment sites. I most certainly feel that without the connections of Ironhack, I would not have had as much exposure to companies looking for junior developers.

Three weeks after the bootcamp, I had three offers from very interesting companies. I can honestly say that none of that would have been possible without Ironhack.

242350,2018.0,True,IRONHACK ROCKS!,"I graduated from Ironhack Miami's UX/UI full-time boot camp this August. This program is by far one of the most amazing opportunities I have ever found myself being a part of. After graduating college in may, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I came across user design experiences through the school General Assembly but found that they did not offer user interface which I wanted to learn. Ironhack is one of the only institutions in the country which offer both. And from what I've learned, only learning UX is not viable enough to take into the workforce, you need to learn interface as well. 

I graduated with a bachelors in art history and had been craving to go into the creative field. At first, I was unsure about Ironhack and was scared to make a move from New York to Miami to participate in this program. But my fears were soon gone after my very first day at Ironhack. The first day, our fantastic TA's told us by the end of the nine weeks, our cohort would become not only our friends but our family. This learning environment is unlike any other I have seen throughout my schooling career. David Fast, my instructor, is a TRUE visionary. He is brilliant, driven, and cares about his students in a way I have never seen in the American school system before. The work environment is so beautiful at building co. You gain the insights of people from their vast background, and you end up growing with your classmates, and they help build you up throughout the entire course. I can go on for hours about ironhack, but all I can say is... if you can take the time to take this course... it will change your perspective, your motivations, and your life in the most wonderful way.

Undecided? Don't be. Take the leap. You won't regret coming to Ironhack.

I recently graduated from the Ironhack Miami, Full Time Full Stack Web Development boot camp in August 2018
I went to Ironhack to learn, hands on and specialize myself in web development after having self studied over two years on my own.

Was it worth it? Yes. Did I learn anything? A ton. Was it hard? Oh yes it was.

The Ironhack curriculum and training is intensive. It will definitely require more than 400 hours in 9 weeks, on your own time, besides your class time as well, mastering the craft in becoming a full stack developer. The hours will be spent in class will also require you to work at home and complete your class assignments, especially during your project weeks.

It is intensive, fast paced, rigorous and incredibly demanding, but everything's done for you to succeed. If you can make it through the Ironhack curriculum, you can make it through anything else tech or life throws at you with an incredible confidence knowing that you know what you know. The instructors are always present as well as the Teachers Assistants. You are not alone as your classmates are going through the same things as you, are here too, working together as one cohort, in unity, fear not, you will always get some help when needed and if your not afraid to ask.

Of course in Tech you won't know everything there is to know when you graduate, but you'll be prepared to have an incredible kick start and keep improving a lot faster than if you didn't attend Ironhack and tried to learn on your own. There are many that can learn well on their own by self study. It's possible. With Ironhack, my newfound skills and experience are now more solidified than ever. This is a lifelong learning commitment even after graduating. Just like breathing. If you are committed to coding, you can't stop coding. Commit. Commit. Commit. It will be woth it. You are worth it.

Your instructor Nick, is the Godfather of Code. If he can't fix it, the code doesn't exist. A gazillion thanks to Nick, all the Ta's, Brito and the Ironhack staff. An incredible life changing experience I will never forget and no longer have to hope for a better future.
Once you've graduated, you're always an Ironhacker. If you ever need anything during your job search, Brito is the man you can call and ask for help, advice, contacts, or even just drop by for events or just to say hello. Just be sure to slack him.

You must be willing to work hard. Not procrastinate and definitely don't hesitate Just go for it. One of the most important investments you will make in your life. This is by far, not an expense, but an incredible investment in yourself. The return is....priceless.",8/28/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
231531,2018.0,True,UX / UI Full-Time bootcamp (Miami) - Take the plunge!,"I just recently graduated from the UX/UI Design full-time bootcamp at Ironhack Miami, and I had the time of my life. It was a very difficult and extremely challenging process for me, but the amount of knowledge and hands-on experience you acquire in only 2 months is amazing. Needless to say, the bootcamp experience is really not for the weak hearted. It pushes you beyond your limits and tests you on every level to really pull out the best within each student.

The most important skill I’ve learned during my time at Ironhack was to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That’s essentially the nature of the course; it forces each student to enhance their strengths, but most importantly, work on their weaknesses. There is limited time to get assignments done, so exercising better time management is essential. There are presentations and public speaking almost every week, there is the constant exercise of accepting failure and making mistakes, and the idea that perfection is your enemy (so if there are any perfectionists out there, get ready to let go of this habit guys, because everything is actually supposed to be “Agile”). I also learned that throughout any UX/UI design process, the user should always be the guide, and you really have to follow and respect the process, never jump to solutions.  

The staff at Ironhack was very helpful and most importantly, were always positive. It really helps to be surrounded by instructors and TA’s who believe in each student’s potential, who are ready to listen when you need to vent, who provide constructive feedback, any help needed or just be uplifting with optimistic comments. I am very grateful to everyone at Ironhack who guided me throughout the cohort: my teacher, David, my TA’s Hugo and Hector, my Web Dev week instructors Sandra and Colby, as well as Brito, our super dedicated Career Resources professional! They just made my time in the cohort extremely enjoyable and meaningful.

Also, being in such an amazing co-working environment such as Building, helped make the experience memorable. I really love it there, I always feel welcome and comfortable, like it is my home away from home. I have spent A LOT of time there, and I love the fact that students have access to the space 24/7 with the use of the fob (I didn’t want to return mine at the end of the cohort!). It is no wonder I would always tell people who asked me about the course that I would live at Building and sleep in Aventura. I cannot express enough how much I loooooved being in that space and am happy to return each time I visit. Everything about it was awesome: the classroom environment with the ability to write and ideate on the white walls, cover the glass walls with our sticky notes, the nook with the comfy couch on the 2nd floor, cafecito at 3:05 brought to us everyday by the very sweet ladies: Mercedes and Maria, and especially the rooftop with the beer on tap. It is just a great space to get inspired, work, and also to network.

The only cons I have for the cohort, is that I wish the course were longer. I personally think 3 months would be ideal, but if not, then at least 2 weeks extra so that the students can have more time to work with the web devs and also to better prepare for the hiring week. I felt an enormous amount of pressure to get my portfolio ready and honestly didn’t feel comfortable with what I presented to perspective employers. So it is important to have either an extra week to solely focus on that or to incorporate it more throughout the cohort (weekly check-ins on the progress, time for business cards to be made). It was constantly drilled into us that “the portfolio is what will get you hired”, so quality time to work on it is essential. Students will be better prepared and most likely result in more hires right out of the hiring fair. So, win win on both ends: great for the students as well as the school. Being able to work more closely with the web dev cohort is also essential in order to better prepare for the field. It would be great to work with them in fully developing one of our projects into a functional app, for example.

Overall, my experience at Ironhack was very positive and this was the best investment I have done for my career. I had to overcome a lot of personal difficulties and blockers along the road, but truthfully, there is nothing more fulfilling than when you overcome something that initially might seem impossible, whether that is fear of public speaking or just delivering assignments on time. I loved every minute of the cohort and will forever be a proud Ironhacker. I have made incredible friends, developed a great support system with the school, and am excited as well as ready for what is yet to come!!!

The whole Ironhack experience was an intense human, those 9 weeks with the same people, day after day, from 9 am to 9 pm most days, taught me more than UX/UI, it taugh me the sense of family, the humility to admit you don't know and that someone else does, and how working together, making compromises, choosing what is best for the user (and not for you ego) makes better outcomes than working solo.

If you're looking at this now, they've probably updated to MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Be ready to work HARD, and put in HOURS to accomplish. The bootcamp says 400 hours, but it takes more than that to be very proficient.

Continue reading for a more detailed look at my journey at Ironhack.

Background: I never worked in anything tech or programming related. I had some programming experience from undergrad and from there on out, I have been taking steps to improve my development skills but felt like I hit a wall.

Why I joined: I wanted to build a portfolio and break down that wall. I wanted to switch careers and become a developer/engineer. I chose Ironhack over their competition because of the MEAN Stack, these reviews, and the passion and family-like culture I received upon initial contact with the staff.

Staff: Ironhack keeps expanding and stays progressive with their vision and every employee really cares and believes in that vision. From the top down, everyone is approachable and makes you feel at home. 

Your instructor? Ironhacker
TA's? Ironhackers
They have been in our shoes. They know what it takes to push you and make sure they set you up for success. They are happy to do it. It is not a ""job"" for them, it's a passion. 

My cohort had a new instructor, Nick. Everything I had read about Ironhack before joining was about Nizar and I had high expectations. Nick did a great job, and he had a great team of TA's too. Lead TA - Sandra is a machine. You will not fall behind even with the fast pace because of this.

Experience: HIRED 6 weeks after hiring fair

To get the most out of this course, you will live, eat, breathe, and dream code. This is 9 weeks full time, and 1 more for hiring week. In these 10 weeks, do not expect to have a life outside of Ironhack. Make sure you have the full support of a significant other because it is not an easy balance. Your friends will be non-existent. It's a boot camp for a reason. Even with some coding experience, I would find myself still at Ironhack until 10-11pm most days. Project week will hit you like a ton of bricks. Beer on tap will keep you sane.

On the bright side, you are going to be in a setting with dozens of people who have the same mindset and goals as you. This makes it a lot easier.

What isn't obvious is that it does not stop after these 10 weeks. When you are looking for work afterward, it is also a full-time job. Expect to be looking for work for 4-8 weeks minimum.

And it doesn't stop there. If you get hired, it's going to feel like another boot camp. So make sure you take that all into account before jumping in and make sure you can be fully committed. 

Job assistance:  There is a hiring fair set up by Brito that at the very least will give you some practice on interviewing. I interviewed with 6 companies and with two of those, I went through their whole interview process afterward. I did not get hired by a company from the hiring fair (but others did).

Brito makes sure you are taking necessary action in your job hunt and guides you. 

I applied aggressively and was able to land multiple phone interviews and several in-person interviews. Rejected by plenty, but in the end, I was able to get multiple offers.

Conclusion: I would do it all over again if I could. I knocked down that wall and changed careers, and made great friends at the same time.

I started as a total beginner and went to Ironhack in order to get the basics on the frontEnd and backEnd sides of the web development process.

The training is short but INTESE ! Nine weeks and hundreds of hours of organised learning and personnal one !

You have to be able to work hard and give up on some parts of your social life for a short period of time but it is so worth it! 

The teacher, the TAs and the whole staff are always there if you need anything ! The classmates are all in the same boat but you can count on mostly everybody to lift each other and work together !

The courses are really thought to satisfy your curiosity and also to attract future comanies.

Don't expect to become a web dev wizard at the end, but you'll be showed the ropes to improve and keep on going !

To be precise on my personal background, I started as a junior and not a total beginner, I went to Ironhack to specialize myself in web development after having completed a longer, more general training which started my career shift.

About the training itself, it is short but intensive, more than 400 hours in 9 weeks, only talking about hours spent in class here, you will work at home too, especially during project weeks.
It can sound harsh, and sometimes it is, but everything's done for you to succeed. The teachers are always present and your classmates who are going through the same things as you are here too, you will always get some help when needed.

The content of the curriculum is thought to be in accordance with entreprises' needs and is evolving to keep it this way. Of course you won't know everything there is to know when you graduate, but you'll be prepared to have a kickstart and keep improving. 

The teachers were all cool but special mention to Nizar who was our lead teacher. His way of teaching has never been boring, good tone and speed for talking, good balance between seriousness and fun... This is really different from about every course I've attended before.

And as a last word, once you've graduated, you're still an Ironhacker, if you need anything during your job search (which could end during the hiring week, next week after graduation), you can call them for help, advice, contacts, drop by for events or just to say hello.

This is a nice opportunity for people working who want to learn new things or professions, Ironhack has this good offer, it is not as the usual Bootcamp where you stop everything you do to concentrate on the bootcamp. It lasts for almost six months, so on the one hand to be honest it is hard time if you are working but on the other hand you have more time to assume all the knowledge and to practice it.

The place is very nice as Ironhack Madrid is located on a cultural centre in Madrid, Matadero. There are good installations and you can go to study there whenever you want. 

The bootcamp is divided in six units, in all of them you have a practice as the lema of the school is “learning by doing”, you can also study online with a nice platform.

Special mention for the teachers, we had six, all of them specialized in their areas, one for UI, other for Research, other for testing, coding, etc. 

Finally, there is a great sense of community at Ironhack, not only for the relationships between pupils, alumni and teachers, but also if you are looking for a job.

244051,2018.0,True,This is the bootcamp you're looking for.,"I did a ton of research before choosing the right program for me, and the moment I found Ironhack I knew it was the right choice. From the very first point of contact with the company I could feel the passion from its team and it was contagious. I was eager to learn more and take my design skills to the next level, and what I got was all that and more. Much more than just a bootcamp experience, the Ironhack experience is about making new connections, new friends, making lasting memories. The hours were long and the work was hard, but it was all worth it. The program is very comprehensive and complete and I received all the necessary support and guidance I needed from my instructor David Fast and teacher assistant Snezana Dragusev. David kept it all fun and interesting, and did a tremendous job at getting the material across, and Snezana was always available to lend a helping hand and keeping the entire class in high spirits. The UX/UI course also comes with an exciting web development-focused week which supercharged my front-end dev skills, all with the help of web instructor Fernando Azevedo. 

The entire Ironhack staff is exemplary, always on the ready to help you out, offer their guidance or just chat with! Huge props have to be given to Alia Poonawala (General Manager at Ironhack Miami), Jessica Gonzalez (Administrator), Patrick de la Guardia (Admissions Director) and Rebecca Willett, General Manager at Building.co, the coworking space where Ironhack Miami is located.

The Ironhack bootcamp also offers an amazing job support program, masterfully orchestrated by Outcomes Manager Daniel Brito. Brito goes above and beyond in helping students learn best practices for job interviews, job tracking, soft skills interviews and generally how to get out there into the real world after the bootcamp is over. The mock interviews and actual interviews are great practice, if nothing more. The guest speakers Brito gets to come in are also a real treat and a part I looked forward to every week of the course. There really is no better way to learn than to hear from actual people who are in the field and have tons of experience already.

All in all, I went into the course expecting to leave with a lot more UX/UI knowledge, but I left with so much more. I am more confident in my own abilities and skills and feel more ready to tackle the world and find the opportunities I long for.

Coming from a person that has no design background, Ironhack gave me the resources to not only believe in myself but expand my creativity. This course gave me a vast knowledge of UX design material in a short amount of time. 

My professor David Fast and teacher aide Snezana Dragusev were a great support and always there when I needed them. Giving me feedback all along the way and inspiring me to think outside the box.

243945,2018.0,True,Gave a new meaning to my life,"After coursing three years of Physics and one year of Computer Engineering in Brazil I decided to attend a programming bootcamp at Ironhack. I wanted to gain the knowledge that would help me develop my own web applications and after doing some research, I found out that Ironhack was teaching about new technologies. Some other bootcamps teach about relational databases (SQL) and use outdated programming languages. I wanted the new stuff. There we learned the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS), which is what you need for getting your ideas out of the paper and put it into practice.

I can say that I am currently fully capable of developing some ideas that never got out of paper because I didn’t even know where to start. I’ve tried to learn by myself, with free online courses, with paid online courses (actually one from Codecademy), but nothing compares to being more than 12 hours a day coding non-stop, doing pair programming, being in a class with other 20 people with the most different backgrounds and experience levels.

At the end of the course we go through a Hiring Week, where we had like 40 interviews with companies wanting to hire people for IT jobs. By now I've learned that of the 28 people that attended the bootcamp with me (ended about a month ago), more than 20 are employed. Included me, I'm currently working in Ironhack São Paulo helping open our new campus and I'm very happy for helping other people go through this same experience. Aside all of that, this was an experience that helped me gain self-knowledge.

Best things:
- Practice. Practice. Practice.
- Support from the teacher assistants
- Advisory on how to build a professional curriculum
- Job interview training
- Incredible networking
- Learning new technologies",7/6/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
243837,2016.0,True,A very helpful start,"I attended the Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack in Barcelona about two years ago. When I attended, I had been working as a web designer for 3 years and I was looking to extend my skills and maybe go for a career change. I though I wanted to do web development, but I wasn't sure yet. Everything I knew at that point was self taught, so I figured I needed some serious study in order to feel more confident. After three months of intense studying during the bootcamp, I must say that I managed to build a web app and I had the guts to apply for a front end position. After some trial and error, I finally got the job I wanted :)

The pros of the bootcamp are that it's really accessible, that there were people there to support us even at 9 - 10pm, that the final project we worked for was really practical and mentored by people working in the field and that at the end we had great opportunities for interviews.
I really liked that the levels of people in the cohort really varied so while some fellow students could help me with certain issues, I could, in my own turn, help other with different issues. This way, you never feel too bad about yourself. We also worked really hard, till late in the night sometimes, and the tutors were there to help. They were really nice, supportive and dedicated. For the final project, based the profile of the project, we got matched with someone working in the field. At the end, looking at what I had built, I felt proud and confident that I could take that app further. The tutors also helped us optimise our linked in profiles, we had professional photos taken and really felt that they did everything to help us find a job that we like.
For me, the biggest benefit was that I figured out what I liked from web development (specifically Front End development) and that I gained confidence to apply for the job I wanted.

The cons are that, indeed, being very accessible, you get people with very different backgrounds and for some it can be very difficult. I had some knowledge of how the web works, of HTML and CSS, but for who doesn't have any knowledge, I think it can be pretty frustrating to dive straight into web development with all its aspects. Also, Back End and Front End are a lot to cover in 3 months, so I would actually prefer it if they were separate. Then you'd have more time to practice everything properly. Sometimes it felt rushed, because we had a curriculum to go through. 

That's about it. All in all, it's really helpful if you wanna taste the web development world and you're not sure which way to go. It also helps to fill in the gaps, if you have some knowledge already, but in bits and pieces, like I did. Good luck!",6/29/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,4.5,[],4.0,,5.0,ironhack

235593,2018.0,True,What I expected...&amp; much more!!!,"What was my situation before entering Ironhack?

1.- An standstill naval engineering career that was leeding me to a self frustration.
2.- The need of a steady job in which I could feel valued and useful at the same time.
3.- A huge passion for web development.

What were my expectations?

1.- To learn the web programming language properly, both in the front, in which I already had some experience (not so much, as I discovered during the first days of the course) and in the back, where I was a complete newbie.

2.- To find a good job to be proud of as a web developer, with opportunities for continuous learning and professional development that would allow me to obtain my desired stability to start building a good vital project.

So...how was it?

Incredible! A week after finishing the course, after metting almost 40 IT companies, all of them convened by Ironhack and most of them of hight standing, with numerous and attractive professional offers, I was signing with one of those companies that I was attracted the most, furthermore, it exceeded my expectations of learning, self development and gave me the possibility of working with cutting-edge technologies. In the end the extended knowledge I got during the Bootcamp allowed me to create three large projects to present to these companies that led them to get a better idea of ​​my new abilities and recently acquired capacities.

What would you highlight?

1.- The training, magnificent, very tuned to what companies require and very refined after the experience of many previous bootcamps' feedbacks.

2.- The teachers, full of knowledge and close to us, they would always be available, either in person or through the chat that we used.

3.- The facilities, forefront and opened 7 days a week in which we passed around 12-14 hours at least 6 of them (7/7 the week of the final project). Comfy, well provided kitchen, WiFi and resting areas.

4.- The great level of camaraderie and union shared among the students. As we spend those many hours together in my Bootcamp the atmosphere was always priceless, I had the opportunity to meet some very interesting people with whom nowadays I continue to maintain contact beyond the mere professional level.

5.- The large number of Meetups and meetings that are offered to help to expand knowledge and to facilitate net-working.

6.- The great work of follow-up and labor orientation that is done during and after the Bootcamp.

7.- The enormous effort that is made to generate community among all the Alumni, encouraging them to maintain contact, arranging open Meetups on the Ironhack campus or simply to share a beer on Fridays.

IMPORTANT: In case it is not clear, the 9 weeks full-time Bootcamp that I did, requires you to be very very focused on your work (as I said, I only rested one day a week and in the week of the final project not even one). There will be many frustrating moments when you face difficulties and hight demanding code problems. Many of the daily exercises you can not do whole. The teachers are there to help but they will not take you by the hand. Actually all that is in fact designed to be that way, it is precisely this challenge that leads you to quickly acquire the knowledge, resources and ease necessary in the 9 weeks of the course.

SUMMARY: Without a doubt, the best decision I ever took. It has allowed me to redirect my career with satisfaction. It has allowed me to acquire great knowledge in a field that I am passionate about. It has helped me to meet great people and to feel part of a community that is always there when you need it. In the end, the reward has been much much greater than the effort invested (also economically speaking).

243746,2016.0,True,An experience worth trying!,"Before joining Ironhack I was working in a field where I'd a very stressful job but little money. I had my doubts about whether or not I'd be suitable for IT and designing digital experiences, as I had experience in traditional products and events. My first step into UX was a job interview, I applied for a UX Researcher position and got the interview! I loved the job and thought: ""I definitely can do this!"". Sadly, I didn't get the job due to lack of specific knowledge of the field (mostly tools, techniques, methodologies and vocabulary). Right away I maid the desition of joining the Bootcamp, a shortcut to get a well-paid job that I really liked. 

One week after starting the UX Bootcamp I thought to myself: ""Now, I'd definitely get the job!"". I learned everything about design thinking, lean & agile methodologies, how to craft a UX Strategy and deliver a meaningful UI, always taking a user-centered approach to problem-solving and product design. 

Ironhack's staff and the teachers' board were beyond generous to help me achieve my goal, getting my first job in IT and becoming a Digital product creator. I even moved from Madrid to Barcelona and could enjoy career service in either Campus. I got a job during week 6 due to my modest front-end abilities and eagerness to learn more. My classmates are still friends, we try to stay in touch and inspire one another, share job opportunities and help us continue learning. 

Now I can say I'm fully immersed in IT, have a better-paid job and can see my career evolution in this field. Ironhack gave both technical skills I lacked, coached me in soft skills and offered a great network to start making my way.

243673,2018.0,False,Worth the time and effort,"Although the work is intense, working every weekday from 9 to 6 and then most of the time leaving for the night with work to do, and also having projects over the weekend, the payoff is most certainly worth it. In just nine weeks you learn how to develop applications with the MEAN stack and then get prepped for the interview process and provided with companies interested in hiring Junior Developers. 

During the nine weeks, work looked like this. We worked on three different modules separated into three weeks each. We would have classes for two weeks and then a project involving what we learned for the third week. A regular day looks like this. In the morning you would study and follow along with a lesson for about three hours. Then you would make an excercise applying these lessons with a partner. After that we would get an hour for lunch and then another block of three hours of learning and then an hour of doing an excercise. The only changes in this were during our project weeks were the workflow was more freeform, and really up to you. There are no tests, no grades, your performance is based on the quality of your projects as they will serve as your portfolio.

After these nine intense weeks you get a tenth week of the course which is exclusively prepping for the interview process and the hiring fair. You practice some technical and soft skills with people that usually do that process in their respective companies. The final two days are were you actually interview during a hiring fair held in Ironhack. This looks like speed dating as there are tables set up with companies, and you go and pitch yourself to them for about twenty minutes a pop. Most of the companies that attended our hiring fair well really reputable places that seem like good companies to work at and keep developing skills.

The only real downside to this course is how time consuming it really is, requiring you to put the rest of your life on hold for these 9 weeks. Overall it was a great experience and would reccomend it to anyone looking to start a career in development. The only thing you need is the willpower to work this hard for about two months.

Thanks to the partial scholarship of ForoCoches I could get to consider changing the direction of my career and focus on what I really liked, web development, I do not regret at all, the Ironhack experience has enchanted me, it has been two months of effort and continuous learning that have been worthwhile, I finally feel fulfilled, I feel that I do what I like and that I enjoy going to my future work.",6/15/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
243609,2018.0,True,"Overall challenging, but great experience","Previously, I was teaching English overseas and discovered UX design. I decided to join Ironhack (Miami) because of the positive reviews I heard from alumni, on sites like Course Report, who had gone through the program and alumni that I had met locally in South Florida. I also read about graduates in the local paper who had transitioned from careers like bartending to web development or UX Design. I was also presented with a partial Uber scholarship to attend Ironhack. I wasn't familiar with design or technology. One great thing about Ironhack (Miami) is that people come with a diverse background. Entrepreneurs, lawyers, former construction workers and some who weren't tech savvy. It affirmed to me that these skills can be learned no matter your background.

I especially appreciated their instructor’s hands-on learning approach. Like most bootcamps, Ironhack emphasizes a learn by doing approach. I worked on 3 different projects and my instructor and teacher’s assistant were very invested in my work, the process and in honing my skills. 

I also got comfortable presenting. We presented to each other and at the end of our cohort were required to present our final project.

I liked the knowledgeable and friendly staff. Although I didn’t work with the staff, I would constantly see their faces and they were invested in our work out throughout the creative process. They’re often checking in our progress and overall satisfaction with the program and instructors. They also dedicated time for pulling industry leaders from the community to come into our class and present to us. This only affirmed my trust in their level of design knowledge, insight and showed how much they are invested in their students’ success.

They dedicated time to job search support. Ironhack (Miami) prepares you well to develop a resume, and offers career support. There is a week devoted to working on interviewing skills (both technical and soft), resume feedback, and a hiring fair. And, at the end of the cohort, they’re constantly checking in on you to make sure you’re working on your career goals even if you didn’t obtain a job through the hiring fair.

Ironhack is 9-5 (in-person) but I found the students typically stayed later and sometimes slept in the building. You should come in prepared to work hard. Collaboration is crucial and spending time in Building Co. in Miami will be a part of the experience. 
Ironhack is fast paced. It doesn’t give you as much time to sit and think about ideas. Often it is more about taking action and figuring it out as you go. Failing fast is something you will have to get used to. Time management is key.

Ironhack is highly collaborative. I worked in teams often during hack-a-hons and my cohort.  It is a great opportunity to practice communicating ideas to others, but it can also be challenging. Be prepared to learn to have empathy for your teammates. My cohort became a family at the end.

The expectations for designers going through Ironhack (Miami) are high. They have a positive reputation in the Miami tech ecosystem. 

Overall, Ironhack (Miami) was a challenging but great experience. I grew immensely as a designer and as a person.",6/15/2018,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

After working as a web project manager in an advertising agency, I decided I wanted to learn to code and looked around Paris for a webdev bootcamp. Unsurprisingly I found many, met them and had to make a hard choice: who would my money go to? Who would actually keep the promises they make on their website?

After reading a lot of good reviews, I chose Ironhack and arrived the first day, still a bit anxious. When I went back home I was fully reassured: I was in the right place with the right people.

Those 9 weeks were so intense, yet immensely formative and empowering. The course material is really very up to date and involves continuous practice during the lessons, and 2 bigger exercises every day. Also, I can tell the lead teacher in Paris obviously loves his job because he's very involved, helpful and patient. Finally, the life at school is pretty dense too, with numerous profesionals coming to school for talks.

I actually loved it so much there that I took a Teacher Assistant position and am now passing my precious knowledge to other students. And I know after that, finding a job won't be a problem for I've already been contacted by a lot of recruiters, met mainly at the Hiring Week organized by Ironhack after the bootcamp.

Students, alumni, teachers, TAs and staff gather several times a week for meet-up events about technology or around beers and pizza, making it a great opportunity to network.

They teach you to think, to look for your life within this exciting sector.Definitely, you get a minimum basis to fight into the real world.

In relation to the Ironhack`s staff , I need words to convey my gratitude. They are a group that follow you and support you until you reach the end. And also they look after you even when this bootcamp is over.

On the other hand, your colleagues, you will never forget them. We will keep on supporting each other ...

242470,2018.0,True,Life Changing Experience,"I am a Marketing & Communication graduate, on my last semesters at university I discovered something I never expected: my true passion was at coding. I started taking some online and in person courses, and as I learned I noticed I definetely wanted to change my career path and take coding more seriously. At first I tried to study bootcamps online to save money and stay at my city, but it was never enough, there are so many technologies to chose from and so much information online! it can be overwhelming, also I was always distracted with other activities. I found out that I had to make a strong decision and focus with some guidance if I really wanted a fast switch, so I decided to quit my job, move to Mexico City and enter the bootcamp. 

IT WAS THE BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! Totally worth it, from beginning to end. I feel like my brain was sleeping my whole life until I was at the bootcamp, I learned so many things, so fast. I can build full stack applications after 9 weeks, something I would have never imagined, my classmates were also great they were always willing to help and make me have a good time, I also found new ways of thinking and living. It really changed my life. Bliss, our teacher was great, he knows so many things, he explains them very clearly and pushes us out of our limits, he is very flexible and puts our learning interests over any rule haha that was awesome. You learn what you need to learn, no useless content. We also had visits from developers of very different areas which gave us insights of their industries and very useful tips.

The whole Ironhack team is amazing. Paula was always supporting me to have everything (payments, interviews, applications) ready and easy to be able to enter the bootcamp, if she hadn't been so supportive maybe my life would still be the same. Anahí, Manon and Julian are always looking for us to be happy, learning and meeting new people that will help us be better.

I studied industrial engineering because it is a 'generalist' engineer,ing and when I was 18 I hadn't clear at all what I wanted to do. So I decided to suffer studying that degree. I finished my studies and I started to work as ATM (Air Traffic Management) engineer in a big company. But I wasn't happy and every morning  I repeated myself that sentence (""I have to change my career"").
I have been always passionate aboyt new technologies, specially everything related to Internet, mobile apps…
And when I read that blog on Internet (of a former Ironhack student), something inside of me decided to apply for the web developmente bootcamp at Ironhack. And I have to say, that It was the best decission of my entire life.
It was hard, very hard. Because I dind't know so much about coding (2 subjects in my degree), and that was ok for the first 2 days. After that, everything was new for me.
Long days (closing Ironhack doors at 23:00), a lot of coke,  frustration, happiness after each project (weeks 3, 6 and 9), friends (one of the best things about Ironhack), Ironbeers…
But after that, I can say that we are ready to work as web developers. Of course, It won't be easy.

243614,2018.0,True,My Ironhack Experience,"I had an over-all really good experience with the full-time web-dev course. I feel like the instructor, Nick, was great for my learning style. The material was, for the most part, really well put together and, for the parts that I felt were not, there was still a lot of value in going over the material. The help that we get in getting jobs is great, present from the very beggining and gradualy increasing until it becomes the main focus for the week after graduation. In general I feel like I got my money's worth

I did have 5 years learning how to code before-hand though, and I feel like that helped me a great deal. So what does this mean for people who have no experience with coding at all? Actually not much. Ironhack provides a pre-work material that I was very impressed by. It has everything that I think someone should know before starting the course. They say it should take about 60 hours of work and they are not kidding. But it has everything you should need to succeed in the class. 

Again, the material is really good, but you have to go over it. They can only cover so much in class (and it will be a lot) but the course is structured in such a way that, to really get the most out of the course, you should be going over most if not all of the lessons. 

Then there are the labs. For most days there will be two hands-on labs. Which I thought was great. They are all really great little tests of the topics that have just been covered. Sadly quite a few of them had typos that made the instructions confusing. We did meet the person who is working on fixing them though. A previous Ironhack graduate who is passionate about getting those issues hashed out. So one of the few dings that I would give the class will probably not be relevant to whomever reads this. And for us it was not all that bad, since the instrutor and TAs were aware of the issues and were able to direct us in the right direction.

Other than the labs, there are 3 big projects, one at the end of every module. Which is one of the best parts of the course in my opinion. It forces students to create things that they can show as experience and were where I learned the most in the course. Simple examples are great, but putting a complete project together really helps everything sink in.  

Overall, I would recommend the course to anyone willing and capable to fully commit to put in the time and effort both in and out of class. There is a lot to get out of the course, but you will only get proportionally to what you put in.",6/11/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

It was quite challenging, but I received the support I needed to advance throughout the 10 weeks. The instructors and staff exceeded expectations. The main instructor, Nizar, teaches in a clear and enthusiastic manner and truly cares about his students' learning. I've been a lifetime student and would not hesitate to say he is one of the best professors I've ever had. I am also pleased with the career services from Ironhack. They helped us with our CVs, our personal brand, and our pitches. All these have helped tremendously during my interviews. Ironhack also sets up a hiring day, where they match students and potential employers for on-site interviews. It was good practice and one company followed-up with me and gave me an offer for a full-stack job (only 6 days after the end of the bootcamp!). 

Potential, but small issues: 1) I've heard from other students that many companies in Paris are looking for developers who know React.js or Vue.js. We learned Angular. However, I personally haven't had any problems with this, and most companies I have met with so far recognize my ability to learn difficult subjects quickly. Even more, most companies have seemed impressed by the quality of our final project. 2) The course is taught in English, but a decent level of French helps when interacting with TAs, connecting with other students in the class, and finding a job afterward.

Now, why did I decided to leave everything and start the Web Development bootcamp here in Ironhack? 

There’s no easy answer to that question so let me put a little bit of background before trying to explain myself.

I started working in Hospitality at the same time I was studying my psychology grade in the university. I always though that this little jobs I was doing were just temporal jobs until I became a Staff member in one restaurant. 
That was the moment I realized that I didn’t wanted this as my professional career, so I started looking something more related to what I really like, and there is when I found Iron Hack.

So i decided to leave everything and start a new adventure in IronHack. And I have to say that I don’t regret at all my decision. 

My experience in IronHack can be summarized in just a few words: “Fear, surprise, work and ‘Sadpiness’”.

Fear? Why Fear?
When you decide to make such a change, to get out of your confort zone, to try something new its absolutely normal to feel fear. Fear of change, fear of the future, etc. 
This fear disappears in the first days of class because you meet a lot of people that have made that change too.
Don’t let the fear make your choices.

Surprise.
That’s what I felt when I started learning “difficult” things that I never heard of before, and I liked them. And talking about them, using them, and even helping others with problems you already faced makes you think “I never though I could learn those things”.

Work.
I’m not going to lie to you, I spent more or less 12-14 hours a day working there. I entered at 9:00 in the morning at I left between 21:00 and 23:00. 
Its hard? Yes it is, but its worth the effort. 
And when you really realized how much time has passed your are finishing your last project on your own, thinking about how fast the bootcamp has passed.

Sadpiness.
Sadpi… what?
Its a new word I have invented because I don’t know how to express the feeling you have when you finish the bootcamp. 
Its Sad because all the people you met, you suffer with, you laugh and sometimes cried. All that people that helped you and you helped during this fantastic journey, are going to take their paths. 
The bond you make with them is strong enough to keep the contact and take a beer once a week (or twice). But not only with your companions, all the IronHack Staff is always willing to help you, teachers, TA’s, etc. 
Thats when you realized you have entered this little big family called IronHack.
And of course is Happiness too because when you finish, you look back and see how much you have changed, without knowing it in most of the cases, in just 9 weeks.

237646,2018.0,True,Stop thinking twice. Just do it!,"Before deciding to take the plunge, I did tons of research about the UX/UI field and the various bootcamps that offered this course. Having graduated a few weeks ago, I can confidently say that I couldn't be happier that I chose IronHack. I feel as though I have accomplished more in 9 weeks than I have in any given year. The quality of work that you will be able to put out by the end of this course will astonish you. Of course, like anything, what you put in is what you will get out. This course is by no means a walk in the park. You will have to work hard - long days and sometimes even longer nights, but it is SO worth it. 

The team and the other students at IronHack become like a family, and the support that you will recevice is like none other. It really feels like a little community. 

I don't have a graphic  / visual design background, so I was a little concerned about the UI section of the course, but IronHack really does a great job of equipping you with the tools and skillsets you need. If you come in with realistic expectations, you will find that IronHack exceeds them. You won't know everything there is to know about UX/UI upon graduation (like anything else, there is a continual learning curve), but you will most certainly have a solid foundation to be able to move forward in a new career. 

Because of unfortunate circumstances, we didn't have a lead teacher for some weeks of the course, which is why I docked a star. However, the team in Barcelona has already rectified this and have hired a stellar lead teacher who is starting with the next cohort. 

I would definitely recommend IronHack and the UX/UI course to friends and family. If you are on the fence about it, I say just do it.

241647,2017.0,True,"I totally recommend Ironhack, intense and amazing experience","I am a student who did the Web Dev Bootcamp in part-time in Paris. 

I was a total beginner in the conding world.

Let me explain what was my experience at Ironhack ;)

As you may know, the course last 6 months and is separated in 3 parts. At the end of every part, you have 1 month to make a project that you choose. Every week, you also practice A LOT by doing the exercises, which are really helpful to understand the common mistakes.

The first part is for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are the basics for front-end development. For me, this was the hardest part, because raw Javascript may have a logic that could be hard to understand at the beginning. But as you go forward you learn a lot, and the teachers are very dedicated to help you. At the end of this part 1, you have to develop a game; which is a very cool way to practice and learn as you code.

The second part is the back-end part, learning NodeJs and Express. You just have to learn the logic and copy/paste what is in the Ironhack course and in the documentation to make everything work. You will learn how to manage a database and use APis (Google Maps' API, Spotifiy' API, etc).

The last part, my favorite one, is to merge front-end and back-end, using NodeJs and REACT, which is a very cool language. Inititally the plan was to learn AngularJs, but the teacher decided to make us learn React, which is most demanded and very useful for what we will have to do. At the end of module 3, we had 1 month to develop and pitch our product. The final project usually match a professional project you have, and the teacher are really devoted to help you success.


To conclude all of this, I really enjoyed my experience at Ironhack, with a super team, super teachers and lot of great people met. I particularly enjoyed :

- the ambiance

- the dedication of the team to help you succeed

- the flexibility and kindness of the teachers

- the courses offered, with all the exercises you have to practice.

236535,2017.0,True,My best decision was to join Ironhack !!,"After 4 long years of studying  International relations at  Georgetown University I decided to take a radical turn with my academic and profesional life and that is when I found Ironhack. I had become increasingly interested in the technological and design world, but as I had no experience whatsoever I did not know where to start. However since I was not planning on enrolling on a full-time masters after four intense years of college and I was not sure the technological world  was indeed my path, I decided an intense 9 week web development bootcamp( in which they guaranteed you would come out knowing how to program a website was my next step. So... I took the leap ! 

If you need to know anything before making  the decision of joining any of their bootcamps , it is that in Ironhack they do not take the word intense or bootcamp lightly. In the 9 weeks of coding, I was waking up and falling  asleep thinking of coding; I was even dreaming with coding. Every day was a new challenge, not just in terms of learning to code but in keeping mental strength to continue on and not surrender. I considered myself one of those people who knew the basics of technology because I was born in the generation of technological develpment, however when I finished course I knew the inner workings of apps and website and how to program them myself. It was a tough experience for sure, but one that I am grateful  for every day.

 The team could not be more caring, they are always willing to help or lend an war and the Ironhack community makes you feel like part of the family from the first day you enter their doors. In 9 weeks of your life you use your full mental capacity and realize that if you work hard and have persaverence  you are able to achieve a profound knowledge in only 9 weeks of your life.  You realize you do not need 4 years of a masters in order to dominate a subject as complex as porgramign  and that you're are able to achieve Wonderfull projects if you set your mind to it.

242268,2018.0,True,From manufacturing to web dev in 3 months,"One of the questions that I get asked most by prospective students is what I feel the return on investment has been. In my case, I was able to transition from a career in manufacturing to web development in a new country (France) and without speaking the local language. I landed a job within one month of graduation! Ironhack definitively played a key role in this transition. Therefore I would recommend it to anybody looking to jumpstart their tech career!

The frameworks taught in the boot camp are aligned with the needs of the industry and provide you with the necessary knowledge to continue your journey afterward. Having learned Vue during the boot camp, it has not been difficult to learn React as an example. Additionally, and this is something that sets Ironhack apart from the competition, we had the opportunity to interact directly with UX/UI designers/students. It sensitized me to the importance of UX/UI and my projects benefited greatly from the feedback I received.

What I would recommend prospective students is to talk with the teachers. Ask them a couple of questions and see if the way they explain the concepts fits your needs. You will spend a lot of time asking questions and the teacher answering them, so the interaction must work for you. You can also talk to the students (and enjoy a couple of beers while at it) or attend the hack shows to take a look at the products the students built.

The results got over my expectatives. I’ve learned a lot of techniques and processes like GV Design Sprint or Design Thinking to get focused to user centered design.

Diría que la realidad llega sólo al 70% de lo que cabe esperar a la vista de su marketing.
A lo concreto: el curso en el que he participado estaba al 100% de su capacidad en asistentes. No cabía ni uno más. 24 alumnos en total. Han doblado lo asistentes respecto a las convocatorias inmediatamente anterior y posterior. Pero no han doblado los recursos. Eso es un hecho. El sistema de TA (profesores asistentes) no profesionales, a mi juicio, no funciona. Si bien el profesor principal presenta la experiencia y cualidades adecuadas, las TA's eran inexpertas y su criterio fácilmente cuestionable. El feedback, algo imprescindible para los alumnos sobre la marcha y resultado de sus proyectos, ha sido insuficiente, en algunos casos inadecuado (hay que dar argumentos, ser riguroso, razonar la posturas, por favor... Esto eso que tratáis de enseñarnos a nosotros los alumnos) y hacia el final del curso, cuando más lo necesitábamos, raquítico. A veces teníamos que andar ""a la caza"" del profesor.

242947,2017.0,True,"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly","Pros: Great school. Alan and Brito were great!

Free beer, coffee, snacks, and the occasional pizza is available for all student.

I got many many many job interviews and was able to get a job offer within 3 weeks after graduation.

Cons: The curriculum was not so great. Typos, outdated instructions, some lessons were skipped, and you had to wait for the class teacher to troubleshoot the LESSONS GIVEN TO YOU BY IRONHACK because they were incorrect. But my biggest gripe was that the lesson instructions were outdated. If you followed some of the instructions step-by-step, your app would fail. This was incredibly frustrating. You couldn't really study at home because you couldn't trust the instructions. You'd had to wait for class to find out if the material GIVEN to you was either correct or incorrect. I hated that because I paid a ton of money and I received sub-par class materials.

If it wasn't for Alan's fast troubleshooting and helpful guidance to overcome the incorrect provided instructions, by whoever wrote the curriculum directions, as well as Brito's amazing help to find me a job fast AND my very own will to invest extra money in outside sources like Pluralsight, Codeacadamy, and books, I would have given IRONHACK a piece of my mind and legally disputed the payment sent to them. 

My recommendation to IRONHACK is to replace whoever wrote the instructions that we followed daily in class with someone who is more dedicated to double-checking their work. Class instructions need to be accurate and easily readable. Memes and incorrect instructions don't teach us anything.

I also hope the class materials, that I PAID for, are updated continuously as time goes by. The instructions are ONLINE for god's sakes. I'm an alumnus of this school and as a customer who paid money, I should be able to go back to the material to study without worrying that my course materials are outdated or forgotten, even 5 years later. Everyone should have access to the same material whether you're from the first class ever in Ironhack to the 50th. If you update the instructions, it should update for ALL who have access to the student portal.

In conclusion: The school is overall great. Alan and Brito were amazing and have earned my respect and it's because of their great work ethic that I did not raise hell. I couldn't say the same for the person who wrote the instructions found in http://learn.ironhack.com/

If you're a student, I recommend you review the course material within the first week with someone else to make sure your material is correct. So that if it is not accurate, you ask for a refund without issue.

240354,2018.0,True,Incredible Experience,"I was part of the first generation at Ironhack Mexico, and I have to say it was a completely satisfying experience.

I had my doubts before attending the bootcamp, not really about Ironhack itself, but the concept of a bootcamp. As I was essentially uprooting my life and moving to a different country (I'm Peruvian) to change my career. I was unsure if it would live up to its reputation, both in terms of the curriculum and the job assistance afterwards.

But Ironhack met every single one of my expectations. I learned so much in so little time, that it still amazes myself. The curriculum and learning tools are great, and the teachers are even better. 

Ironhack has not only taught me a lot, but it has given me the tools and perspective I needed to keep learning on my own, which I already started to do.

It's only been 2 weeks since the bootcamp ended. The job assistance has been great. We had the hiring week shortly after the bootcamp ended, and the companies outnumbered us, some of them were even looking to fill multiple positions. 

I can't recommend it enough, it's certainly not easy, and you have to put in a lot of work, but in the end it's worth it.",4/11/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
240027,2018.0,True,One of My Best Life Decisions,"I think when evaluating such a massive life and financial decision as a coding bootcamp, the most important aspect of the review is how likely the camp is to get you a job. I can say this: I came into Ironhack with an incomplete computer science degree and no meaningful work experience, and left with three scheduled job interviews, and I had a competitive entry-level developer job offer within two weeks of graduating. I don't think my experience is typical, but I do feel safe in assuming that if you come here prepared and work hard while you're here, you can leverage the experience into a new career.

Before signing up, though, it's worth mentioning that the curriculum and instruction is in a period of transition. The previous instructor, Nizar, moved from Miami to Paris, and was replaced with Louis. Louis lacked Nizar's experience, and became less professional as the cohort went on, being less prepared for more advanced material and often leaving mid-day, letting the TAs (Jess and Sandra, who were both fantastic) manage the class. Louis isn't coming back - he decided to go to Japan after finishing the cohort - and I'm not sure who his replacement is. If you're interested in the camp, that's the first thing I'd ask about.

The curriculum is largely solid, but has a few intermittent bugs and grammar issues. Honestly, though, I'd rank it above my college experience in terms of usefulness and structure, as well as any class I've seen on places like Udemy. It's intelligently structured, and gives you the information required to learn the skills necessary to complete exercises and build projects. They're also actively working on fixing issues in the curriculum right now, and it's a safe assumption that you will have a cleaner experience with the material than I did.

I think the quality of the job assistance matters more than the quality of instruction in a bootcamp - realistically you could teach yourself everything here with a few Udemy courses, a solid work ethic, and maybe some contacts in the coding community or online - but it's hard to leverage that into a job. Job assistance is where Ironhack shines. Their job placements manager, Daniel Brito, is constantly working phones and email to get respected developers in the community to give presentations and companies looking for talent to come to hiring fairs. He has tons of resources to teach you how to manage your job hunt, and is pretty much constantly available for questions on Slack (or in emergencies, his phone). This effort is reflected in the experience - if you do as he says, you'll develop contacts in the Miami tech community, which will lead to job offers. 

It's also worth noting the location is incredible. The building is right next to a train stop in downtown Miami as well as a decent parking garage, and is blocks away from dozens of fantastic restaurants. The building itself is also amazing - it's a well-appointed coworking place with free snacks, coffee, and beer on tap. 

It was scary signing up for Ironhack, but I honestly think it was the smartest decisions I've ever made in my entire life. I learned an employable skill in less than three months, got to make dozens of friends with other like-minded and driven people, and leveraged the experience into a new job. Expect to work hard - the 400 hour estimate they give you is low, and the most successful students were those that showed up a few hours early and left a few hours later - but if you do, it'll change your life.

One more thing - if you decide to sign up for Ironhack, take a cohort date a few months from now, and spend some time learning the material. Colt Steele's Web Development bootcamp and Advanced Web Development bootcamps on Udemy are a fantastic primer for the large majority of the class, and completing at least the first course beforehand will give you a huge leg-up on learning skills well and making solid, presentable projects, which will help you significantly when job hunting.",4/10/2018,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack

239232,2018.0,True,Bet on yourself,"I graduated from the part-time Ironhack Course in January, 2018. Looking back I'm truly upset I did not join IronHack sooner. l belive coding bootcamps like Ironhack are truly challenging traditional schooling. IronHack helped me gain a future-proof skill, separating myself from the majority of the US's workforce, for 1/10th of the price in 6 months. Also I didn't have to forfeit my salary to accomplish my goals. Graduating from Ironhack I had two job offers. One from a company brought to the hiring fair by Daniel Brito, and another from (my-then) employer. 

Will this course be easy? 
This course will NOT be easy, but do not let that discourage you! As everything else in life you get out what you put in. From my experience the students that would log the hours doing the course's excercises and learn on their own had the best portfolio. Having a great portfolio translates to...job offers!!! (Log those hours behind the screen and build something damn it!)

Ironhack Staff
In short the staff is excellent. Remember they are there to ensure your success. The coding bootcamp model only works with the success of each and every student. Their whole business model depends on the students' success, therefore they bend over backwards to make sure we are not only happy but successful. Special thanks to my professors (Alan + Nick) and TA's (Sandra + Gus). My success was a direct reflection of your hardwork.

Classroom Environment
The classroom environment is built to facilitate creative learning. Building.Co provides a nice shared workspace that helps foster a sence of community. The 3rd floor patio is a nice getaway even in the middle of downtown. Lastly, there is beer on tap. This is especially nice to relax and network with classmates. 

Overall
Ironhack has helped me become more niche (valuable) in the tech industry. I am extremely impressed with the overall product they provide. I have a Master's Degree and this bootcamp made me more valuable in 6 months then my previous 6 years of education. Furthermroe I made my initial return on investment my first year as a programmer.

240005,2018.0,True,Web Dev Full Time,"Overall my experience was very satisfactory.  I knew almost nothing about coding and felt like a left knowing the basics, and where and how to continue my studies.

The curriculum, when it comes to beginners, is very complete, although I have heard from more expreinced programmers that it teaches some technologies that are no longer relevant.  Still I feel it escaletes in a way that it doesn't overwhelm people who are just starting to learn this language.

The TA's where the best part of the course, they were completly devoted to the cohort on a very personal level, doing overtime and putting in all the effort they had so that we could get a good learning experience out of this.

Unfortunetly I cannot say the same for our instructor, who didn't seem very invested in our cohort, and after encountering some frustrations with the curriculum I guess, lost all interest in teaching.  

The staff was very friendly, but seemed to be a bit desorginzed.  I say this because there where several trips and exchanges of personal, which didn't leave much time for us to get to know them and learn from them.

One thing I would advise strongly, which I think was a big error in my experience, is to never leave the cohort with less than 1 instructor and 2 TA's.  Unfortunatley in our last two weeks, which coincided with the two weeks we had to prepare our final projects, our teacher left every day at 1pm, and didn't help much during the morning he was there, and one of our TA's took another position within Ironhack, which left just one person helping a class of 20.  This was extremly unfair, for everybody had doubts and needed help, but there was only one person to clear them.  Thankfully in the second week a new TA joined the class, but even though he had good predisposition, he had not been with the cohort during the whole course, so the amount of help he could provide was different.

At the beginning of the course I didn't  have many expectations that the User Experience world was serious enough or that there were many job opportunities.

After these two months of intensive course, I discovered something that I'm super passionate about and that I now consider fundamental in the future of every company. I believe that the UX is beginning to be more and more recognized, and companies are realizing how important it is.

Ironhack is a magnificent course, in which I have learned by doing. All have been practical cases that assimilate the reality with which you will face tomorrow. We have learned both working methodologies (design thinking, lean, agile) and tools (canvas) and above all, a clear structure of how to carry out a project from the beginning (UX) through design (UI) to the end (presentations of projects to the bosses, recognized people and classmates). We also had a week in which we learned the basics of front-end to know how to behave in the working world with the developers and work hand in hand with them!

In short, without hesitation I would do this course a thousand and one more times!

No free time, none of my friends, (almost) none of my family, neither my native language speakers… I remember not speaking English after 5 pm the first days of classes just because I was tired of it. Now, I have daily English conversations and I don´t even realize in which language I´m talking.

One of the most important skills I learned in the course that I will take through my whole career is when you get stuck make sure you take at least two hours searching every resource you can before approaching your teacher or boss with the question. Which then leads into don't be afraid to ask questions, just make sure you have all the evidence to back up that you've tried your hardest to locate the answer and truly they will respect that.

Everyone I met there is a hard-working, super smart, talented, ambitious and like-minded individual.

You don't have to have any experience in programming but without one it will be challenging for you, so be ready. I suggest taking CS50 (Harvard's free online course - intro to computer science) prior to this course. After completing CS50 you can definitely see if programming is for you.

Here are some tips:
-  There will be a lot of information to digest. You need to get serious about your time management. Limit your work, parties, and other activities.
-  During the course, try to complete all pair programming and independent exercises each day. It will help you later with your projects.
-  Choose your projects wisely and don't neglect front-end (design).
-  If you are not local to Miami and going to rent a place - try to find one as close as possible to the school, so you don't have to waste your time commuting. Brickle is a great area, safe and everything in a walking distance, including Ironhack.

The experience was absolutely amazing and unforgettable. Prior to Ironhack, I had started studying a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own for about a month or so. After seeing the difficulty of trying to learn Web Development on my own, I decided to enroll in the full time course. 

You will have to push yourself in order to successfully get the full experience of the course. If you think this is something you can walk into with minimum effort, you will be humbled very quickly. The description they have is dedicating around 400 hours, but it was easily closer to 550-600 hours. The material is definitely hard to grasp at first and you will have imposter syndrome, but if you are persistent you will definitely make the most out of this course. The more you put in, the more you will get out of it. It's only 9 weeks, invest in it and in yourself. 
If I had to choose the best part of this course, it would without a doubt be the community that you are surrounded with. You will be with your classmates for 9 weeks straight, 9+ hours a day, and they will become your family. Being surrounded by like-minded individuals working towards a common goal was what made me excited to come into class everyday and code. You will laugh, cry, complain, and succeed together. Take advantage of being around this sort of community, you never know when the next time is that you'll see them!

The staff is great. The TA's (Sandra and Jess) always made sure to check up on the students and were always willing to help no matter the situation. Brito, your placements manager, will put you in a great position to confidently look for jobs. 

The coworking space you are in is great. You are in a great spot in Brickell, surrounded by successful companies. Tip: Use the free resources here, all of them. There are a lot of free events in the building, take advantage!

With all this being said, the bootcamp is not perfect but it was 100% a great investment and an unforgettable experience. Come in with an open mind, eagerness to learn, and a positive attitude and this will be a solid investment.

Quick tips from a recent grad:

Use your outside resources. Don't limit your learning to the curriculum. You will need to see the material from different perspectives to really grasp these concepts. The lesson on Ironhack platform should be the starting point. On the lesson topics, you should google related articles, watch related videos, ask the instructor and TA's to expand on these topics.

Ask questions, whether that be during a lesson or when working on your code. Ask your TA's. Ask your classmates. Everyone is willing to help you.

I can say that Ironhack is a great place to study, teacher’s and staff in general are amazing. 

Ironhack is a great place to network. I had a beautiful experience with all the people inside, they are like a family to me. You can notice that they select good persons with values, people that are hungry of learn more, increase their knowledge and succeeds in life. That is so important to me because it motivates you and gives you the right environment where you can grow. In order to achieve your goals and dreams you always have to work hard, and Ironhack was definitely another challenge for me. 

Also, Ironhack not only host meetup events, but also let the students know the best events going on each week. It is reallhy interesting that every week there is a different person that is currently working in the field that comes in as a guest speaker. 

So I can say that my overall experience was very positive. During an extraordinarily intense 9 week period I was exposed to a vast amount of information and tools to learn such as sketch, InVision and Flinto. That was great, because as I’m already a designer for almost 9 years, my goal was to learn more tools.    

The location in Miami is building.co which for me is the best co-working office space in the downtown Miami. Great concept space, you have a great view of Miami that helps you to be inspired during the time you have to work on your projects. 

Don’t expect to sleep, do expect a life-changing experience, be prepared to work hard, stay focus which can bring you to have new a more doors open.

243294,2018.0,True,Craving for code… visit Ironhack!,"Dear future or current developers, 

I would like to write a review with a double intention: 
· Help you orientate if you are wishing to do a developer bootcamp
· Thank Ironhack team for they unconditional support

1.	Learn latest technologies
   The school is aware of how the market evolves. That’s why in previous editions they’ve teach Ruby on Rails or React. Don’t worry on the technology, just trust them, companies are always interested for the latest techs as they are trying to get updated. 
   I was surprised to see that even programmers with 10 years experience were joining the bootcamp to get updated on technologies. Companies will value those learning’s, don’t worry. 

2.	A dedicated team that encourages learning
   At Ironhack I’ve coded next to smart and passionate teachers. I was surprised by 6:30pm after 9 hours coding they were there teaching me last details of the lesson I hadn’t understood or even helping me improve my projects. One teacher and three assistants on the full-time bootcamp, where else are you gonna find that much support?!
   Moreover, the rest of the staff is unbelievably friendly and supportive. They will weekly ask you for feedback and make that you feel like at home (that’s for example how we got our BBQ at the rooftop and a Ping-Pong table) :D. Believe me you’re gonna get surrounded by an awesome atmosphere. Staff takes very seriously on QUALITY, proved through the learning units, IT events, job placement, fully equipped kitchen and much more.  

3.	Hiring week
   Compared to other bootcamps or online courses, Ironhack were the only ones offering some kind of direct shortcut for placement. Last week you have the opportunity to get interviewed by 20-30 companies. They do not assure you to get a job, but definitely you’ll have an experience on how to deal and prepare for technical interview. You won’t lack of a job on IT field if you work on your skills.

4.	Awesome classmates
   This will depend on every cohort. Usually Barcelona attracts people from all around the world (in my cohort: Canadians, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Caribbean, Portuguese and of course Spaniards). Sincerely, I am gonna miss my mates a lot. They were the reason and the necessary support to keep coding by 8:00pm, when all what your head whisper to you is: “Go home!” We’ve spend great time together having Ironbeers, roomscape, music festivals, lunch at the restaurant (of course, most of it on weekends, week if for coding haha).
   I also want to thank the UI/UX students. We’ve had the opportunity to collaborate at some point and also see their projects as they have seen and advice on ours. We’ve also had true programmers coming from different industries to evaluate our projects in order to decide for the three contestants that deserve to present in the Hackshow. All this makes the experience much more complete and close to the real working world.


5.	Coding bootcamp, online courses or autonomous learning at home?
   I speak from personal experience: I’ve tried learning from home, but then if you get blocked maybe you can spend 4 hours with no clues. That gets soon very frustrating and increases the chance you give up with code. That’s not how it is supposed to be in the working environment.
   You’ll probably get great contents with other online courses, but as soon as you want to go further you may face technical problems. At Ironhack, teachers give you the right support to be little bit creative at the same time they train you with all the basics to be able to continue your own-training after the bootcamp. 

6.	Full-time or Part-time
   Both are great! Part-time will require you the endurance to go coding after your other regular timetable that you follow, but also full time will challenge you 9:00 to 21:00 for 9 intensive weeks… be ready to abandon all other social compromises that are not having beers with your Ironmates! 
   Part-time also allows you to develop your projects more calmly (as you have almost one month to deliver each one of the final projects), but then it will depend on your discipline to commit to work even at home.

The main teacher of the program is very professional and the way he transmits his knowledge is perfect. Other TA's are always there to help you. They are changing and adapting the program to make it better. If you decide to do Ironhack Bootcamp, you'll have to be a little bit prepared (in my opinion) and practice before. Ironhack Team is like a family, everybody there will help you to reach your goal and make you feel very comfortable. Very easy to make friends and networking. You will also have a buddy (somebody who studied in Ironhack) for you to get introduced faster and better in Ironhack Family.

I think the bootcamp is really worth it. Just be ready to give it all during two months, because you'll make the best out of the course if you make a great effort. Particularly during the three projects.

243156,2018.0,True,JOIN IR&lt;3NHACK,"Hey you, most probably you are in the situation right now I was half a year ago. You are maybe asking yourself if a bootcamp is the right thing for you. Six month ago, I was as indecisive as you right now. I tried out some online resources of really basic programming languages and noticed I really like it, however I was not sure if it is enough to put all on one card and pursue a career change.

Now after the bootcamp has ended, I can tell you that it was totally worth it. If you are a person that feels uncomfortable with the comfortable and aspire a career where you feel that your effort work is really meaningful than just go for it. In the review I try to stress out why Ironhack is the right choice for you. Enjoy the read : )

TEACHERS & CURRICULUM
I couldn’t think of better teachers than the ones from Ironhack. Learning from Andre, our main teacher, was an incredibly valuable experience. He is not at all comparable to any other teacher I met in the course of my academic journey. He is inspiring, incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in all realms of the industry. The same applies to the great technical assistants. Everyone is really eager to help you and motivate you throughout the course. 
I don’t want to sugarcoat anything, the curriculum is intense and your personal outcome also depends a lot on yourself and how much effort you put in. Be consistent and don’t stress out when you don’t get a concept right a way. You will get there with sufficient practice. As Andre taught us, they give us the shoes; we are the ones to put them on. Apart from the curriculum, you will have the chance to educate yourself in related fields. Almost everyday there are events, lectures and workshops that you can attend. 

BARCELONA OPEN SPACE
When it comes to the right location for you to attend a bootcamp, Barcelona is definitely the place to be; the city is vibrant, young and is known for its growing tech scene. I recommend you to make use of all the great facilities that the Ironhack office provides. You’ll have the possibility to be at Ironhack 24/7. The open space with all its facilities offers you the perfect place to unfold your potential and really immerse into the world of programming. There is also a flat upstairs with a nice rooftop to study and have a barbecue with your IH friends to unwind after hours of learning and coding. The staff really trusts you guys and gives you all the freedom you need to feel as comfortable as possible. They are all really attentive to your needs and are very perceptive to any feedback. In general, the staff is always friendly and always approachable with whatever question you have.

JOB PERSPECTIVES
Regarding job perspectives, it is a bit too soon to be opinionated since it’s two days since the bootcamp is over. However, if it helps you to get an idea, everyone from the previous cohort landed a developer job before our cohort ended. The placement manager as well as the rest of the team are really supportive and provide help with your portfolio. Also, the hiring week at the end of the bootcamp will help you to get in touch with different tech companies in Barcelona. 

PREPARATION
I’d like to make a short remark for those of you who have no prior knowledge. Although the program does not require any prior preparation besides the pre-work, I strongly recommend you to prepare yourself upfront using free online resources with main focus on JavaScript. It will keep your frustration level lower in case you are starting from scratch. However, don’t feel intimidated by this, it is not required and you can go along without any pre-knowledge.

IRONHACK FAM
Last but not least, I would like to address a very special thing about the program. When applying for Ironhack, I mainly focused on the learning experience itself and haven’t thought so much about the positive factors that this course brings along. But believe me, it’s the piiiiipool that make this experience so unforgettable! Although you might think that 2 1/2 months are a pretty short time to build close relationships, the bootcamp will prove you wrong!! You will have an amazing time with amazing likeminded people and will grow close together as a group. The group dynamics were unbelievable. We did a lot of different activities where everybody was included from day 1. We had legendary Friday nights, did rooftop BBQs, ping pong tournaments, samba nights, skiing trips and so much more). The Ironhack quarter really becomes your first home, the people your family and coding the nexus between both!

243113,2017.0,True,Miami Part-Time UX / UI Course Review - A++++ Would Recommend,"I took the first part-time UX course offered by the Miami campus. The course started in August 2017 and ended in March 2018.

Here's what you need to know before you start:

1. There is pre-work, and lots of it. You will need to do this before you go to the first class - if you don't do it, I will find you and I will haunt you personally.

2. You will need to find some kind of transportation that gets you to Ironhack or you will need to pay for parking. If you're bougie like me, there's a garage behind Ironhack and they do offer monthly parking, but their daily rate is $10. If you time it just right, your weekday classes will cost $6 to park there and the Saturday class will be $10. You can also find street parking around the area but pay attention to the signs!

3. You will have homework during the class - expect to spend 10 hours a week on this, excluding your class project and your capstone - you will spend more time on those and you might have a couple late nights building presentations. If you don't do your homework, I will find you and I will haunt you personally.

4. You'll want to make time for local events -- there are plenty for UX around the area and that is an excellent place to network.

5. When you're in the class, pay attention!

6. Your cohort will be full of people just like you. You might even become great friends with them - they are your network, and so are all of the Ironhack graduates. You'll find that this community is full of dedicated, hard working and caring individuals - we all want each other to be successful.

The instructors:
We had Joel, Marcelo, Alex and Fernando teaching us. I hope that every cohort has these teachers or at least similar people - I cannot express how awesome they were. All of our teachers were excellent life/career coaches to us and all of them have been continuously supportive and available to us no matter what day/time it is. Joel taught us mostly about the overall process, Alex taught us about research, Marcelo taught us about visual design and sketch/flinto, and Fernando taught us HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. All of the instructors are local heroes in the industry and all will be able to teach you every tool you need to become a successful UX designer.

---

The staff:

The staff at Ironhack is amazing. You'll have a TA helping you through your exercise; lean on them for support! You'll also interact with the Ironhack staff at various events and they will come cheer you on in your presentations. I really love the staff at Ironhack because they are warm, caring, inviting and always available. Alia was my first introduction to Ironhack and she has been absolutely amazing. She helped me figure out that I would be a great fit for the UX program, and I am SO glad that she did. 

The staff really went out of their way to come after hours to support us, even though they'd already worked a full day. They also came on weekends occasionally and I always felt like they cared about our success. 

Brito will be available to you for career help and to walk you through how to find a job, how to interview, how to create a resume, etc. He is invaluable and extremely well connected. You have no idea how lucky you are :-)

Overall:

I had the most amazing experience and I know that I can walk into any interview with confidence and the tools I need to succeed. 

Everyone in my cohort really bonded; we are all group texting now and I know that each of us are rooting for each other's success. I will always be there to help my classmates and I know they'll be there for me, too!

Honestly, a true testament to the fact that I like Ironhack and the teaching method so much: I decided to take the full-time front-end web development class, which graduates in June. This means I won't be joining my cohort's career fair, but I have no doubt my classmates will be successful and land their dream jobs :-)

243102,2018.0,True,9 weeks to simply change it all,"t’s day one. You ring the bell and enter a strange land which will be forever your home. You sit next to an unknown person that you will never forget. And so it starts. You finish day one: you think you might not make it. Day two: the faces start to be familiar but you’re struggling with the names. Another bunch of concepts on top of the ones you learned the day before and that you still don’t remember. You know you won’t make it. It’s the end of the first week, you have laughed, you have been frustrated twice (per day) and you have shared lots of memories with 21 new family members. What you are able to do by now was unbelievable five days ago. You know for certain that this is the change you were looking for. And there are still 8 weeks to go. 

The whole Ironhack experience is one the best decisions you will ever make. Never a journey has been so long and short at the same time.

243105,2018.0,True,Mi experiencia como Ironhacker,"Intentaré ser breve y conciso para los que quieran una review corta y sencilla:

Ironhack es el mejor bootcamp tanto si lo que deseas es cambiar de ámbito profesional como afianzar y/o mejorar tus dotes de programación. Personalmente, es la mejor decisión que he tomado y estoy super orgulloso de haberlo hecho.

Para los que quieran una review con mas información intentaré hacer hincapié en los puntos fuertes de este Bootcamp:

1- El temario: No solamente te enseñan a ""programar"" desde 0 sino que te preparan para ser autosuficiente una vez acabado el bootcamp. Me explico:
 En Ironhack aprendes MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express,Stack Angular, Node) + HTML5 & CSS. Y esos conceptos aún con el poco tiempo con el que disponemos, arraigan en tu cerebro como si llevaras meses estudiándolos. Yo tenía un poco de Background en temas de CSS y HTML y en la primera semana ya estaba aprendiendo cosas nuevas que no sabía.
Una vez acabado el Bootcamp puede estudiar cualquier tecnología de manera autosuficiente. Esa seguridad que te da el aprender cosas nuevas y saber que puedes hacerlo, no tiene precio.

2- El equipo: Teacher & Ta's.
- Decir impresionante, me quedaría corto, por lo que voy a decir únicamente que somos unos afortunados por tener a estos profesionales enseñándonos todos los días. André es una bestia en lo que a conceptos y manera de enseñar se refiere, personalmente es una persona muy cercana y se puede hablar con él de cualquier cosa. Sabe transmitir los conceptos de una manera sencilla y fácil de entender, y creedme, en este mundo no es nada fácil. Los TA's (teacher assistant) están ahí en cada momento en el que necesitamos ayuda y nos quedamos atascados en algún ejercicio y/o proyecto. 

3. La familia Ironhack.
- Desde el primer momento nos sentimos cómo en casa, nos dijeron que pasaríamos más horas ahí que en nuestra propia casa (no me lo creí al principio, pero... si, es cierto). Y es que al final, preferías quedarte aquí con tus amigos trabajando que irte a casa a hacerlo solo.

El staff que está con nosotros es impresionante, desde el primer día te cuidan para que estés a gusto. Nunca han tenido una mala palabra, ni un gesto raro, ni una mirada especial. Estoy encantado de haberl@s conocido a tod@s, no sería lo mismo si no estuvieran aquí.

Las instalaciones son perfectas para el tipo de ""trabajo"" que estamos desarrollando aquí. Si tuviera que hacer mi propio Ironhack lo haría de la misma forma que lo hacen ellos, cada centímetro está pensado a la perfección para que los que estamos estudiando aquí como los que trabajan estén a gusto.

Finalmente y una de las cosas que me llevo y recordaré toda mi vida; los compañeros. Desde el principio congeniamos muy bien, la mayoría de nosotros estamos aquí para dar un cambio a nuestra vida laboral y en su efecto a nuestra vida en general. Tenemos muchas cosas en común y somos muy parecidos en la manera de ser (algunos más y otros menos) pero con el equilibrio que en todo sitio se necesita. Hacemos actividades conjuntas casi cada día (no es obligatorio!), desde Cervezas cada Viernes(y su fiesta posterior) hasta BBQ los fines de semana, Scape Rooms y visitas por la ciudad.

Finalmente, si has llegado hasta aquí es porque lo estás pensando muy seriamente, no lo dudes. Únete a la familia Ironhack y no te arrepentirás, yo no lo he hecho :)

You've probably stumbled upon the Ironhack website and you're contemplating, ""Is this the right decision for me?"". When I decided to join Ironhack I didn't realize it would be one of the best decisions I would make. For most of my adolescence I didn't have many challenges in university, but Ironhack tested my personality, my passion, and my knowledge. The friendships I've created will be everlasting as well as the memories that came along with it. It is in an intense program and most of the times you might feel frustrated, tired, and even cranky, however, the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment that comes along with these feelings are the best residual effects you can experience. It eclipses frustration, fatigue, and mood with ease. I would recommend this bootcamp to everyone everytime without hesitation whatsoever.

243036,2016.0,True,10/10 Would Recommend,"Ironhack was undoubtedly one of the best decisions I’ve made not only for my career, but for my personal growth and self esteem. 

From the initial interview to the my very last day, the team and instructors made me completely at ease in my lack of understanding and were intentional in checkups and encouraging me and my classmates to push ourselves. 

I had zero experience in coding when I first entered the course and was incredibly intimidated. On my first day, I felt pretty anxious and out of my league, but the instructors, TA’s, and Ironhack staff make you feel at ease even when you feel out of place. They are patient and are genuinely interested in your growth. Nizar was our instructor for our bootcamp who is hands down one of the most talented instructors I’ve met. He is able to meet you where you are and is accommodating to your needs in the classroom. It’s easy to feel incompetent in such a large subject that is completely new, but Nizar and his team do a great job of making you feel comfortable in a challenging space. He also has a gift for teaching students with all backgrounds and will meet you where you are in your understanding. 

The bootcamp is intense, but it’s well worth the time spent there. I came out with confidence in my new skills even though I knew I had a lot more to learn. The bootcamp provides you a great foundation along with a large network of talented individuals who are more than willing to help you navigate through the tech realm as many are completely new to this space. 

There are a lot of valuable resources as well. They keep you well informed on all things tech happening in the community and Daniel Brito, the Placements Manager, prepares your for your interviews leading up to the end of the bootcamp.

Daniel Brito is invested in your time at the bootcamp and your time afterwards. I still go to him for questions and advice in regards to job hunting or interviews. I gained an internship as a Jr. Web Developer within 1 month of the program because of the confidence and tips I received from Daniel Brito and the team. 

Overall, I think that if you are looking for a quality bootcamp then I highly recommend Ironhack. I loved the community I built and the challenges that were presented to me. If you want to take your career to new heights or just challenge yourself in a safe space - this is it.

243032,2018.0,True,From absolute newbie to brave contender- my dive into coding through Ironhack,"Oh boy. I haven’t written anything besides code in the past three months, and the longest piece of text I’ve typed recently was a string for a database. So how do I begin with this one…

As a foreword of sorts, I didn’t know a thing about coding before I decided to apply for Ironhack’s Web Development Bootcamp. I had seen pieces of code before, and I could understand them just as well as ancient Egyptian. Until then, I had worked in the fields of journalism and communications, but if you have paid any attention to the world and its changes, you won’t need me to tell you about how hard it has become to make a career- and a living- in that sector nowadays.

What I’m trying to convey is that, at first, coding was my Plan B, a way to escape unemployment and get back on track- but I had no idea if I could handle it, or if I was going to enjoy it at all. And (to my own surprise), not only did I make it, it also seems that I enjoy coding- although it still gives me the occasional headache. 

It might feel like I’m rambling, and I apologize- but there is a point in all of this. Like myself, many consider going into coding, but they wonder if it’ll be the right thing for them, if they will struggle trying to understand how code works. And I’ve come to find that you don’t require an intensive technical background to become a web developer or programmer. True, you need to tackle problems with a very different mentality compared to other trades, often needing to examine the task from every angle and understanding exactly what you will require, and what items will be involved, before you write the very first line of code. But once you adopt that mindset, code becomes less of a threat and more of a puzzle that challenges you and ignites your curiosity.

Getting used to this new strategic, however, is just the first milestone that you will have to conquer. Our worst enemy during the bootcamp wasn’t Javascript, Angular or any other framework- it was frustration. The pace of the lessons rarely gave us time to catch our breath, and the daily exercises (both individual, and in pairs) would often test our limits. On a couple of evenings, I found myself with my head buried between my hands in a moment of panic, telling myself “I can’t do this, I wasn’t ready for something like this”, and I wasn’t the only one. 

If I’m painting a bleak picture so far, don’t worry- I’ve resorted to the “bad news, good news” mechanic to save the best for later. Although intensive, the bootcamp (divided in three ‘modules’ of three weeks each, with a final project at the end of each one) helped me understand the basics of code in a very comprehensive way, starting with basic exercises and steadily increasing the number of iterations or the challenge they offered. The bootcamp covers many areas that are key for a developer including Javascript basics and advanced features, layouts and design, database management and package management to expand the possibilities of our frameworks- and yes, all of that sounds like a lot at first glance, but again, even a complete newbie like me managed to successfully complete the bootcamp.

Now, my classmates and I are getting ready for the hiring week. For some of them, this will be a ‘level up’ in their career; for others, this is the start of a new one, and although I still have much to learn, I feel prepared to walk into web development with my head up high. And in addition to this, my final project -a website for musicians to find one another and start new bands and projects- became more than just a task to deliver at the end, and I have decided to continue working on it.

However, having mutliple Teacher Assistants and an excellent Head Teacher (Marc), alongside with cooperating for the completion of the daily exercises with the rest of students has made me learn the tools for building not only a simple website (which is pretty much what I was expecting from the course) but a proffessional platform.

243016,2017.0,True,Part-Time UX/UI  Course - AMAZING,"I just completed the first Part-Time UX/UI Course at IronHack Miami. Now that it's over, I am confident that I have been given all of the tools I need to become a successful UX/UI Designer. 

Regarding the course: the material is extensive, the pacing of curriculum is fast, and expectations are high. This has been the most intense educational venture for me (even more than my college degree). After everything, I couldn't be happier.

The most important part:

After everything I have done to get to this point, I can readliy tell you that IronHack is worth every single penny. These are just a few (of many reasons) why:

The instructors and staff are genuinely invested in your success
The curriculum evolves often to stay current with technology
IronHack is a hub for many activities in the growing Miami ecosystem
The alumni are extremely active, friendly, and easy to network with
They care so much and really make the effort to connect you with job opportunities (thanks, Brito!)
Things to Consider

When you are enrolled part-time, the workload is a lot more challenging to navigate. This is because you are required to attend 2 weeknights from 6:30pm-9:30pm, and all day Saturdays (that's not including study and project time). Consider what it might be like for you to balance IronHack with a full time job. 
Apply as early as you can, as mandatory prework is assigned for you to complete before the start of the course. It helps get you familiar with the material and be prepared before your first day. I completed mine over the course of a month (a few hours here and there), totalling about 40 hours to finish. 
There are expenses that you will incur that are not included in your tuition:
Be prepared to pay for parking, as the school is located in Brickell. Parking is located on the street (estimated $2/hour) or in a nearby garage (flat fee $10/day)
Also be prepared to have about $300 extra saved to download the software you need or for miscellaneous items (Sketch, Flinto, and I am forgetting the others at the moment) 
$50 for a FOB, which is a key for 24 hour access. It gets reimbursed to you once you are done with the course. 
I think that covers it!

Overall thoughts: IronHack is the best bootcamp EVER and deserves way more than 5 stars!!! <3 <3",3/11/2018,Part-time UX/UI Design ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
243009,2018.0,True,"Life changing, life brightening and slightly addictive","I'm 40 years old, I travelled the world and lived very intensely. Trust me if I say that the whole Ironhack bootcamp has been one the highest ranking experiences of my life. Let me explain you why.

Coding is hard. Learning to code in 2 months is very demanding and does seem totally impossible. Believe it or not, the Ironhack campus in BCN is designed at every level (from the location, the building itself, the staff, the teachers, the syllabus, the events and the job opportunities) just to make that happen. It doesn't get more ideal than that. Let's address these points one by one.

Location: Barcelona is one of the most international cities in Europe. You do breath modernity and opportunity here, especially in the Poplenou neighboroud where the campus is located. It has become a kind of tech district, so on the way to class you pass by real tech companies and it gives you a feel of where you might end up working. Feels like you're there already.

The campus: Fantastic open space with glass walls (Kanban boards drawn on them), plants hanging from the ceiling, kitchen, showers, desks, standing desks and tons of architectonic eye candies. It's like your mind expands in there, and you're hooked. You don't want to leave. In fact you don't. You're given the keys and take advantage of the 24/7 access policy. You'll need it on project weeks!!

The staff: They're doing a fantastic job at keeping the place so well organized YET very informal, frienly and welcoming. I felt like I could express myself without having to fit in to any particular mould, and that was very valuable to me, because during the bootcamp you are reinventing yourself and pushing your brain hard on coursework in order to do that. So nobody will judge you if you spend hours by a standing desk coding and dancing looking more like a dj (or a crazy person) than a developer. You're tired? You can take a nap in plain sight. Wanna play? Let's skate or play football, inside of course. Nobody will ask you to stop. The staff is committed in having you become a web developer. They know kicking a ball will help your unconcious brain solve the kata.

The teachers: Andre has been one of the most inspiring and influential professional I ever met. The guy has more than 20 years of experience, and he knows how to deliver it to you. His technical knowledge is so intimate that I'm sure he natively thinks in Javascript then compiles in English for the rest of us. But it's not just that he tought us a programming language (and to love it), he focused a lot on best practices and the workflow and mindset you have to adopt in order to transform your ideas in to products through coding, and having fun in the process.  Then, he passed on us so many insights drawing form his own experience, filtering out for us the most valuable. Maybe not obvious at first, but Andre insights sit on the brain and release value as time passes by. And also, it must be said: he let us appreciate how cool a fully fledged web dev can be. 

The teaching assistants: Ironhack employs the most suited students as teaching assistants for next cohorts. They're three, with different levels of experience depending on how many cohorts they survived. Yes, because it's not easy to stay patient having to debug horrible code by current students still not having a clue!! What you get from them is the closeness of relating with somebody who just finished the bootcamp, as well as accurate code revisions and debugging, directly from somebody who still remembers on what silly thing you're more likely to get stuck on. They were stuck there too just a couple of months before, they know how and where to help.

The sillabus: Javascript is on fire nowadays and Ironhack is one of the few bootcamps to base its entire curriculum on it. Backend, frontend, all JS, because this is the present and the foreseable future of web dev. In fact, anything different would have felt like time wasting. The course is divided in three modules, each module giving you the teaching first and then challenging you on a project. The course material is constantly updated, you get exercises on a git repo to work on all night if you want. You'll get a detailed revision of your code in the morning. In the first module you learn the basics, HTML, CSS and JS, and make a late 90s style JQuerish app with it. Addictive brain gymnastics. Then you're introduced to Node.js in the second module, but server side. Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express. And you make a '00 style server rendered MVC app, which almost feels like a real thing. In the third module you're thought a Javascript framework (this time it was Angular 5), and are given two weeks to complete your own full stack project. At some point while doing it, which happens at different stages for different people, it's guaranteed that you will see the light. Like in the Karate Kid movie you'll see how all they made you do click together. Your fingers begin flying on the keyboard, translating your thoughts in to code as if it was the most natural thing in the world, while you wonder what the hell is happening. That's when a web dev has finally emerged from within you.   

Events and job opportunities: Each week we had at least a couple of talks by external speakers, giving us insights from within the industry. That has been very valuable, the best one was somebody explaining us how to make a bot using Dialogflow, with git repo and all. Fantastic. Unfortunately, you are likely to be very fatigued by all the mental work you're doing in the bootcamp to fully engage in the talks. But it is all meterial you can go back at a later stage, having had direct exposure to it, and maybe even networked with a real tech-industry specimen. And we came to job opportunities. I yet have to attend the hiring week which is organized at the end of the bootcamp and it's supposed to be a kind of speed dating between us graduate and tech companies. BUT, during the last event one of the speakers gained an interest in my final project and we're now exploring the prospect of remote work for his creative, amazing and well established start-up. So yes, nothing concrete yet but I can't beleive the fact I'm actively asked for interviews even BEFORE I start searching for a job. Amazing.

Last point to address is the people. I barely been alone during these two months, the group spirit has been fantastic. From spending the night all together coding, to partying at campus on the weekends, I felt so fortunate to get to meet so many great people. On a personal note, that was even more important given the fact that I lost my father while I was attending the bootcamp. It wasn't an easy decision to stay and learn coding, but it was the right choice. The understanding and support I received from the staff and the other students has been invaluable, don't know what kind of place I would have been without it. 

I do reccomend the course, it delivers on expectations, but be ready to push yourself as hard as you can in the learning process. There's no magic, it all comes through hard work. Ironhack will provide you with the best environment, tools, knowledge, people, it's like a state of the art gym: the sweat is still all yours.

242303,2017.0,True,BiBencias de un Hironjaker,"Es lunes, hace un frío del carajo en la calle y tengo los cojones por corbata. Llevo yendo unos días antes a IH y he conocido a unos cuantos alumnos que me acompañarán en las clases por lo que no estoy tan nervioso como podría ser ir desde cero, cosa que muchos de mis compañeros no podrán decir pero ahí están todos sentados en la grada escuchando recitar al cabrón de Mark la bienvenida y a los teachers reforzando su lengua afilada con los nuevos. ¿Mi primera impresión?, tenemos un Dr. House por profesor, ¡genial! Una vez acabado el discurso de bienvenida nos metimos en la clase en la que permaneceríamos los 2 próximos meses viviendo, comiendo, trabajando con nuestros compañeros en pair programming, sufriendo por poder alcanzar la meta de los 3 proyectos…pero es curioso, porque la primera semana piensas que es eterno, la segunda te plantas pensando que en una semana tendrás que hacer…¡¡¡¿¿¿UN VIDEOJUEGO???!!!, pero como si de un río que te arrastra se tratase te plantas en esa famosa semana, ¡y sorpresa! Consigues acabar un juego cuando 15 días antes no sabías ni lo que era un DOM y mucho menos un canvas. 
Fin de semana después del proyecto, mucha cerveza y algo de estudio el domingo intentando no llevarte la ostia que te dieron en el primer módulo rezando para que el mantra de lo que los antiguos alumnos no sea verdad “el segundo módulo es lo peor”, y ahí estas en el segundo módulo mirando como las vacas al tren, sólo eres capaz de pensar WTF? Cuando te empiezan a hablar de Express (si, express me voy a venir abajo), Node y Mongo. Cada vez que toca hacer un pair programming miras a la pareja que te toca intentando averiguar si eres el único que no ha entendido ‘na de na’, pero según dicen ‘es el proceso natural’ te dan de ostias y luego esperan que aprendas ¿pero que coño me estás contando?, así no se aprende ni pa…espera un momento, si me paro a pensar se que es un constructor, una instancia, una query, un ejs…si van a tener razón y todo estos cabrones y voy a estar aprendiendo, escocido, pero lo más importante, aprendiendo. Llegamos al final de las dos semanas y nos toca hacer un proyecto con una pareja, me tocó con una persona muy afín a mi por lo que me sentí como pez en el agua y ofrecimos un buen trabajo. Es el final del segundo módulo, tengo una sensación de tristeza porque queda una semana de clase y después el proyecto de 2 semanas, más cerveza y relajando motores porque el segundo módulo fue muy arduo y doloroso.

Finalmente atacamos la tercera semana, sentimos como si nos estuvieran metiendo a presión deprisa y corriendo Angular sin ser capaces de entender que significa la palabra ‘reutilizable’ pero ahí estamos en una semana aprendiendo todo lo posible aplicando Passport a nuestro proyecto, juntando todos los conocimientos que tuvimos para dar a luz a un proyecto que representaría el top de nuestro aprendizaje dejándote el sudor y rezando para que no te salga un ‘unexpected token fatal error’, para una vez más presentar tu proyecto, recibir un aplauso y…se acabó.
¿De verdad, y las vivencias, gente, profesores, amigos?
Si te contase las picarescas y las vivencias tanto positivas como negativas, ¿vivirías realmente lo que tienes que vivir o intentarías vivir lo que yo te contase?

Now, near two months after finished it I can say that it works, that it is possible to learn all these technologies in nine weeks and that it was probably one of the best decissions of mi live.

It is nine intense weeks in which you learn almost a new technology per week, a lot of new concepts and they takes you to the limit, but the reward is bigger enought:  see that you can, that you're able to creat an functional app from zero in a technology of that you only knew its name one month ago...

245052,2017.0,True,Unique.,"I had the chance to experience the full time Ironhack web development bootcamp last October. Needless to say, the 9 week journey Ironhack provides is different to any kind of education i've been able to endure. It's a very fast-paced environment but truly rewarding:

- on a personal level: you find yourself constantly self-improving on a daily basis with the teamwork of your classmates and teachers. I have met some truly incredible people (both staff and students) that have inspired me since day one to keep going. Ironhack can be your second family if you put interest on your part, and that's a very high drive to keep setting yourself new goals.

- on an educational level: i'll be basing it from my experience in Madrid, but you receive class from a Lead teacher and have multiple Assistant teachers there to help you and not fall behind. In my case, not only were there 4 of them, but all four have insanely receptive qualities to make you feel comfortable enough to ask pretty much anything. Same goes for the rest of the staff.

- on a professional level: perhaps the most important and differential factor, Ironhack has their own recruiter/laboral department that is commited to helping students find a workplace they'll enjoy once the 9 weeks are finished. May you find a job a week after finishing or not, they'll keep in touch with you (and I mean REALLY keep in touch, via slack or in person on a weekly basis) until you find something that fits you.

On a final note i'd like to emphasize this: what YOU get out of Ironhack does not depend entirely and exclusively on them. It will also depend on the personal interest and motivation you have. The chance to network with hundreds of students from previous editions on a weekly basis is a fail-proof way to see that the model just works. It just depends whether you're compatible/comfortable with the idea of giving your 200% for 9 weeks of your life.

241734,2017.0,True,Just do it.,"WARNING: This is the longest review ever. 
 
All right. I've been pretty excited to write this review. Honestly, these reviews were what helped me make a decision and although I’ve never written a review before for anything, I knew this one I had to write. I wondered what I would be writing once I finished the course; and I have to say that probably midway through the course I already knew: Just do it. 
 
So, this review has two parts two it: Before Ironhack and During Ironhack. I wanted to give my story so that you have some context and maybe it’s similar to your own story and helps you make a decision. And if that doesn’t matter to you, then just scroll down to the second part :)
 
BEFORE IRONHACK
 
Upon my college graduation (earning a degree in communications — so not technical at all), I found a job for a small company located in a WeWork while still holding a part-time job at a restaurant. At WeWork, naturally, the job feed was filled with posts for developers. I saw how much opportunity there was and I decided to play around with programming with many of the free resources online. After realizing that it was something I could pursue professionally, I decided to quit my job at the small company so that I can work full-time at the restaurant and study so that I can become a developer. (Working for a restaurant is not as mentally strenuous as an office, so I figured I can at least make a living and study.)
 
Fast-forward a year.
 
I was still working at the restaurant and I was still studying. I missed my personal deadlines and extended deadlines before I thought going to a bootcamp would be a good choice. I was really reluctant to do a bootcamp because, honestly, the information is freely available out there so why should anyone pay for it. But I realized that the money that I would have saved by studying on my own, I already lost. If I had done the camp sooner, I could have had a job in tech sooner and I could have made back my investment already. Granted, some people can study this own their own and that’s awesome; I, however, am not one of these people. I could say that my only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner, but, honestly, I’m glad I ended up in the cohort I did because I met some amazing people that greatly impacted my experience. 
 
DURING IRONHACK
 
Oh man. The first week wasn’t bad. We went over material that I had covered on my own so I felt pretty confident. The week after that? Yeah, things got harder. What’s interesting about the experience is that some concepts will just click and you’ll feel good about what you learned that day. Other days, some concepts just won’t click and you’ll leave with a pounding headache and feeling defeated. But you’ll come back the next day. You’ll go over that concept again — while learning a new one — and you’ll keep doing that. Eventually, it just clicks — but I really have to give thanks to Nizar, our instructor, for helping that happen. Nizar knew our weak points and knew what he was going to have to go over and over again. Sometimes he sounded repetitive, but the man knew what he was doing.
 
A little more about Nizar — he is an incredibly talented teacher. When you ask him questions, he won’t just give you the answer. He’ll guide you so that you arrive to the answer. And like I mentioned before, he knows students’ trouble spots. Sometimes he would jump through certain bits of the curriculum because he knew it would be better for our learning. He was even willing to give us extra time — during our final project week, we stayed with some of us until midnight helping put out all our fires. He didn’t have to do that. And I think the other amazing thing is that he was always encouraging you. He could tell that sometimes I would get frustrated, and he would just remind me kindly/matter-of-factly, “It’s going to get easier with time.”
 
The rest of the staff at Ironhack is amazing too. They’re all so interested in making sure that you have the best possible experience; granted, it's in their best interest to put out the best quality product, but they work hard at it and they know you’re here to change your life and they don’t take that lightly. They do weekly surveys so that they can constantly improve. They don’t just treat you like customers but like friends, sharing with you about their lives and experiences. And overall, they’re just genuine people which adds positivity to the environment.
 
Another staff member you’ll be interacting a lot with is Brito. He’s going to become more important later on in the course as you start getting ready to go to market. And, of course, he becomes really important as you actually go to market. The guy has a ton of connections (and he wants you to exploit them) and he is there to help you (and he will help you) — you just have to do your homework. (Some students got hired before we even graduated because of his contacts.) He is also the guy to tell it like it is — and that’s exactly what you want with someone who is supposed to help you land a job.
 
Another amazing thing about Ironhack is the environment. But again, the environment is founded on the people. You get to go everyday to this awesome co-working space surrounded by like-minded individuals. People who have decided to make a change in their lives and just go for it. That momentum is was catapulted my learning. I had peers who I could turn to when I needed help or they turned to me for help. You have an amazing support group for when you’re down and wonderful people to laugh with when you need a little break when you’re staying until 10 or 11 pm coding away. It’s really hard to find that and Ironhack has found it.
 
Overall, I wouldn’t trade my experience at Ironhack for anything. The environment is awesome, the staff is awesome, and the material is awesome. But the most important thing I learned (and I know you’ve already read this) is how to learn. Even with that year that I spent learning on my own and even taking a paid course at MDC, I learned more at Ironhack after the first week. This is just the tip of the iceberg and there is so much more to learn, but now I can build and learn while I do it. Do research, make a change, and give it your all.

241592,2017.0,True,Best thing I've ever done ..,"Taking the UX-UI Full-Time course here at Ironhack Miami is the best thing I've ever done.

241621,2017.0,True,"Ironhack- changing students' lives, one at a time!","The most important skill learned through Ironhack's UX/UI Design course was the systematic approach to probelm solving. In learning UX/UI design methodologies you learn to problem solve using guidelines that optimize the solution through careful consideration of the ""user.""

Maite was my instructor and she was simply phenomenal, her passion for UX and her UI skills were beyond impressive. She is an influencer in the UX/UI design community and her ablity to inspire the class and instruct us in the techniques Ux'ers would need to be successful was inspiring. Maite always maintained a professional attitude and never displayed disappointment in the class or any student -she always maintained a sense of inspiration and the class responded to her instruction with universal admiration. If you sense a degree of admiration for her, I can assuredly state the admiration was felt by every student in our class- she was amazing in conveying the concepts that were new to us and ensured we fully understood the principles being taught. I can't say enough about the quality of education I received at Ironhack and it was the result of the superb instruction Maite conveyed. I would highly recommend Ironhack in an instant to anyone looking for a coding school or UX/UI design school- I can't imagine any school surpassing the standard the instrcutors and staff set at Ironhack- they are beyond reproach.

Keri was the other part of the success myself and the other students achieved at Ironhack as she was the ""teachers assistant"" for our class. Keri teamed with Maite to form an unbeatable combination of class instruction........if any student needed clarification on any aspect of class instruction, Keri was always ready with a smile-never showing a hint of despair. The chemistry between Maite and Keri was a pleasure to experience as they formed an unbeatable teaching team. Keri displayed complete mastery of UX/UI design principles and eagerly helped at a moments notice, she clearly has the qulaities of a top level instructor.

Brito is the ""Placements Manager"" and I've yet to see anyone more passionate about matching students with carreers. Brito is often found running around the school creating/maintaining contacts for carreer fairs to ensure every student has the maximum chance of successful job placement. He is a core component to student success with unmatched connections in the Miami tech industry and is highly regarded and respected. Brito always maintains a level of approachbility and availablity and is 100% committed to matching up students with the correct potential employers. Students normally interact with Brito near graduation time as he interviews every student and forms a relationship and pairs student traits to the best matching employers. He clearly takes great pride in his success rate in matching students to carreers and truly enjoys his role in student's success. 

The Ironhack staff was always courteous and approachable. The staff actually knows every student by name and always maintains a level of ""friendship"" that is difficult to describe. On 1st day of enrollment- the entire staff meets with all the students and engages in ""name"" games to enhance name recollection- this is an ingenious concept to student introduction and clearly works as the staff calls everyone by name! The school has a very 'informal- tech startup' feel which is likely intentional and helps foster an enviornement of learning and friendliness.

The classroom environment also featured a ""tech startup"" feel with it's glass walls and sense of openess to staff and students alike.  I would not change a thing to the learning enviornement, it was pleasing and provided a relaxed feel.

My experience at Irohack was completely positive- the instruction and curriculum was flawless and the staff was always friendly. Ironhack sends weekly e-mail 'surveys' asking how they might improve the school or staff and it was difficult in making such recommendations. My suggestion was to add a ""soda"" machine to the upstairs kitchen as I don't drink coffee or beer!

Ironhack is more than a school- it is a place where life-long friendships are formed and fostered. Both students and staff alike bond in a unique way I was not expecting and this sense was echoed by my fellow classmates. Ironhack is a place where lives are being changed and oppourtunities and dreams are being realized ..........I fully recommend this school and know anyone who enrolls will likely have the same experience and will be ready for their new carreer.

So when you're ready to experience the most unque learning experience you'll ever engage in and ready to meet a super-friendly staff, enroll in Ironhack and get ready to be called by name.....I was beyond imprerssed and bet so will you!

Get ready for a life-changing experience because I was not and I'm so glad I attended Ironhack.....new friends, experiences and careers are waiting!

241004,2017.0,True,Ironhack Miami UX/UI Fall 2017 Bootcamp,"Why I Did the Bootcamp

I have a business background and decided to get into UX earlier this year.  If you look me up in Medium, over the holidays I will be posting a much longer post on how I made the decision to get into UX.  

Many folks have learned and practiced design and web development on their own.  Make no mistake, it can be done - but since I don't have a design background, I wanted a program that could guide my learning.  But guess what - all of the other 8 students in the class had a design background of some sort and they found it worth to take the course as well.

The thing about design is that it's more than just making something look good.  It's about knowing how to solve a specific problem, applying best practices, AND making it look good.  And you can't do that in a vacuum, you need others to critique your work, you need to know how to work with clients and you need to know how to work with developers.  And that's what Ironhack exposes you too.

Before taking the course I read reviews not just about Ironhack, but about coding and design bootcamps in general, and some of the reviews were pretty bad.  Some said they didn't prepare you for an actual job in the real world, that they were just diploma mills and wanted your money.  I can't speak for the other bootcamps out there, but Ironhack is ballin'.

Finally, I am from Washington, D.C., relocating to Miami.  Getting into Miami Tech seemed daunting; I didn't know anyone, didn't know what companies were hiring, didn't know any contacts.  And now that I've just graduated, I can say while looking for a job is still a challenge, it is in no way daunting.  I know my stuff and I know what's out there.

About Ironhack

Before applying for the course, I visited Ironhack and one other bootcamp in Miami in person.  Ironhack is located at Building.co, a coworking space in Brickell (downtown Miami).  Right now I'm typing this to you from the rooftop patio on the third floor.  It's baller.  More importantly, our classrooms are nestled in between real tech companies that occupy space in the building.  At least once a week I run into the startup founder that won Refresh Miami's Tech Demo Day in October.  I'm not just learning about tech, I'm bathing in it.  Furthermore, the vibe here is just different.  I feel like I'm wanted here, like I belong here.  I've made what I think will be lifelong friends.  

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the staff here is just... the real deal.  Really.  And they're respected in Miami Tech - I know this from attending networking events and mentioning that I'm an Ironhack student.  I've only gotten positive responses from saying that.

Alia, the GM, personally called me to congratulate me on getting into the program.  When my wife came to visit the course one day, she welcomed her as if she was another student.  You can't fake that.

Brito, the placements manager, is so well connected he probably knows Barack Obama and Obama doesn't even live in Miami.  And he's sincerely interested in our success.

Marisa, the program manager, and Pat, the admissions manager, are similarly supportive and friendly.  

And finally, for the UX/UI fulltime bootcamp this past fall, we had the most amazing Instructors, Maite and Kerri.  Maite had done UX in Paris, London and I think New York and is world class.  Seriously.  She eats, sleeps, drinks UX.  Like I'm almost worried for her sometimes that she needs to get to the beach more.  :-) . She pushed us very hard to be our best, yet I knew every day she cared for us.  You can't fake that.

Keri, our TA, had completed the course previously and was the cheerleader we all need when completing a program like this.  It's hard.  If you give it the level of effort you need to be a great designer, it's even harder.  And she was always there, answering our questions and encouraging us through frustration.  

In Conclusion

I don't know what the future holds.  There are no guarantees.  I know it's hard out there.  But as far as it relates to my professional life, where we all spend the majority of our days, I'm more hopeful than I've been in a long time.

Whether you choose to do a bootcamp or not or Ironhack or not, if you're reading this I hope you find peace and meaning in whatever you do, and live courageously enough to work through fear and pain to better yourself and others.

240850,2017.0,True,Incredible Experience With Incredible People,"When I first signed up for Ironhack I kept asking myself if I made the right decision. I was concerned about the price, if I would really get hired, if I'd leave feeling accomplished and fulfilled with the curriculum, and if it would all be worth it at the end.

All my doubts were crushed within the first week of the cohort. I loved our instructor, the entire staff, and made instant friendships with a good amount of my class. I was learning so much in a small amount of time, I felt pressure, but the pressure felt good. Every day I'd learn something new and with the curriculum, I was able to apply it right away to a project of my interest.

Prior to Ironhack, I was confused about what I wanted out of my future and thanks to this opportunity I know have the skillset to enter an evergrowing field that is highly in demand and is only growing with the technology around the world. I had received two phone interviews before even graduating so the hiring rate is real. If you work hard you will get opportunities, there is no doubt about that. I hope to close a job offer before the holidays to start 2018 with a career in this new field.

But after a 9 week course with an amazing instructor (""Nizar"") and a great aid (""Dapper Dan""), I have learned many valuable skills and can create a webpage and/or site, as well as understand code in general.

I believe the most important thing I learned at Ironhack would be learning how to read code and debug issue's that I may come accross in my future while as a developer. Along with the help of a great placement manager (""Brito""), the future has many doors that will surely open up for my career change into the tech industry. 

The staff at Ironhack is very passionate and always willing to help or give advice if needed. Ironhack is by far one of the better life choices I have made in my life and I would reccomend it to anyone looking to learn how to code.

240995,2017.0,True,You Can't Go Wrong with Ironhack,"If you're wondering whether you should join a coding bootcamp (and you are GENUINELY interested in pursuing it), stop what you're doing and APPLY RIGHT NOW. 

The reason I write the above first is because that is what I saw in several reviews I had read when searching for the right bootcamp. Yet, every time I would always think to myself, ""Is that really the truth, though? Will I regret making the jump?"" So before I write the rest of my review, I can tell you that those reviews were right!

Before joining Ironhack, I was working at a digital marketing company in operations and product development (and before then I had just graduated with a bachelor in Architecture), so clearly I had zero coding experience prior to Ironhack. After about a year of debating whether I wanted to make a career change, I found Ironhack. I put my fear aside and reached out to ask for a campus tour here in Miami to get the ball rolling.

Application Process: The first person I met at Ironhack was Alia, and Alia does NOT dissapoint! I felt such a great energy from her and genuine interest in getting to know me and understanding why I wanted to join their program. Shortly after, I applied and scheduled my three interviews (general interview with admissions, career interview with Brito, and a technical interview where you must solve a coding challenge). All three interviews went great (again...the only experience I had was working with developers, but never the actual coding aspect). The moment I received a phone call from Alia that I was accepted into the program I immediately felt two things: extreme excitement with a side of fear of ""what did I just get myself into.""

Cohort (9 weeks): The structure of the class is exactly as they describe it on the site. Grab your coffee in the morning, learn, code, lunch, learn and code (did I mention the coffee is free and unlimited?!). What really made the course, though, was our instructor Nizar and we were so lucky to have him! The way he explains the concepts is very clear for the most part and, to someone with no coding experience, I was able to understand what he was teaching. He never says no when you need help, and what's great about it is that he doesn't just hand the answers to you. He makes you think about what it is you're doing and what you need to do to get there. Now, I'm not saying your journey will be easy, because it won't be. You need to put in the time inside and outside of class to make sure you're not falling behind. The course moves quickly, so it's very easy to fall behind if you're not keeping up. You will feel like (and I can only speak from the perspective of someone with zero coding experience), ""Holy crap, there is an entire universe of coding that I did not know about,"" but don't get overwhelmed! Don't let it discourage you, but do expect to be learning for the rest of your life as we all know how quickly technology can change. 

Finding a job: Brito, the recruitment manager at Ironhack, is also someone you will meet and never forget. Keep in mind, he is not there to hand you a guaranteed job on a silver platter at the end of the cohort - and he will make that very clear. He does a great job of coaching you on what networking events you should attend, what you need in your LinkedIn and in your resume, and is available whenever if you have any questions or need help. There is also a hiring fair where companies come in to sit and interview with you, I have yet to experience it as our fair is not until January, but it's great to know that we get the opportunity (thanks to Brito) to have that chance of ""speed-dating"" with several companies who are looking to hire.

Overall, my experience was amazing. I don't regret making the jump and am lucky to have been able to attend Ironhack. For the past 9 weeks it never felt like I was going to ""school"" and I was always excited to go in the next day to learn something new. The environment, staff and vibe of Ironhack was the cherry on top and I'm so glad that I chose to stay in Miami and attend their course.

There was not one day during my time at Ironhack that I regretted that decision. It has been one of the best and most powerful choices I have made, because it literally has life changing consequences. 

What I came to realize, is the initial investment in a coding bootcamp, is exactly that … an INVESTMENT in yourself. Forget investing in other things that you have little control over, because the best choice you can make is investing in yourself by investing in your own education. I did weeks of research prior to joining Ironhack, and without any doubt it is the best coding bootcamp in Miami. I never felt like anyone was being fake with me, I never felt like I was being treated like a “number” in some education mill … this is absolutely nothing like that. My professor was Nizar and he was extremely intelligent, kind, and was accessible at all times. The whole staff is. One of the cool things about Ironhack, is witnessing staff members like Nizar, Brito, and even guest speakers, just staying for hours after their shift ends to teach and talk more with fellow students… When you see these things, you come to realize that Nizar, Brito, the guest speakers, all help because they truly love their job.  I think thats really the key difference your going to find, its like this perfect crew of people who love what they do, are passionate, and love playing a key role in helping others in their journey to success.

240987,2017.0,True,Amazing Bootcamp!,"Before starting at Iron Hack, the most experience I had coding was simply watching the 1995 movie ""Hackers"". Other than that, I had no idea what I was doing. Coming into this, I had researched many other coding bootcamps and visited with many others as well. However, none of them gave me the same vibe that Iron Hack did. What do I mean by ""vibe""? I mean that they actually cared about their students. Most of the other schools came across as simply trying to get me in the door, but Iron Hack literally took the time to sit with me, one-on-one, and very sincerely asked me ""Why do you want to do this?"" I gave my explanation as to why I wanted to do it and they proceeded to give me a detailed account of what my everyday schedule would be like and the amount of work that would be required of me if accepted. Every other school I visited would just give a generic ""you can do it, just work hard!"". The staff is unlike any other. Our Professor Nizar was basically, what I believe, every professor should be modeled after. This man would go out of his way to ensure that you understood what you were doing. He never simply gives you the answer, he works with you until you understand how to get the answer. He's also hilarious and made what might seem like a dull topic at times into something fun and interesting. Also, as part of the staff, you will have what is basically your guardian angel, Brito. You worried about getting a job after this bootcamp? Don't be. LISTEN TO BRITO. This man will not steer you wrong, and as long as you're putting in the work Brito is going to bend over backwards to make sure you find a job that is right for you.

240960,2017.0,True,Game changer! MIA OCT-DEC 2017,"I was part of the Oct-Dec 2017 cohort at the Miami campus. This has been hands down the best decision I've made in my life. It is most certainly a game changer. If you are thinking about it, my advice, stop thinking and do it! I understand most people considering a web-dev bootcamp might be overwhelmed at the idea. However, it is not like what you are thinking, this is not a traditional college lecture or highschool classroom ( time flies by ). This is a new home and a new family. I think there was only one person in the cohort who had a degree related to computer science, other than that person, no one including myself had a computer science background. We still succeeded, in just 9 weeks we already had 3 projects under our belt and being able to do full stack apps on our own. 

Much of what makes Ironhack what it is, is how the faculty interacts with each other and with the students. Their work culture is so amazing, they have a special type of relationship, nothing like I have ever seen before. Of course this translates to the students. The staff develops a relationship with the students and in my opinion this improves experience so much.

The learning doesn't stop there. At least for me, I took to learning other things during my free time. Things that weren't necessarily part of the curriculum, but I wanted to take advantage of having an instructor to which I could ask anything any time (literally any time. My instuctor would get back to me on Sundays! ). 

Ironhack gives you all the tools you need to succeed. From how to write amazing software, to what to say to future employers (more of this below). Like anything in life the you have to do the work, but my Ironhack family definitly made so much possible. The most important tool that I learned at Ironhack was how to ""LEARN"". You can't expect to become a the best developer in 9 weeks, but you can expect you will graduate with knowledge on how to become one! If you put in the work, I can guarantee you this. 

Nizar, our lead instructor is the man! The guy is legit one of the smartest people I've met, and one of the most patient as well! Trust me, dealing with me is no easy task. However, he was always there for me, and like I mentioned above, he even answered my questions on a Sunday. Rarely (very rarely) will he give you the answer to your problems directly, he does much more for you, he tells you how to be resourceful and where to look or something along those lines. You end up solving the problem on your own and because of this, you learn so much more. The whole teaching staff is amazing, Ironhack always have great T.A.s. Our T.A. Dappered dan was the man. He was also always accessible.

The experience does not end there. At Ironhack, they have a placement manager. His name is Daniel Brito. What do you need to know? Brito is one of the most connected people I've ever met. Everyone in the South Florida Tech ecosystem ( maybe all of South Florida ) knows who Brito is. His background makes him the most qualified person for the role. His been on both sides of the table when it comes to hiring. If you decide to take the course, make sure you follow his every word. Why? Well I did, and I had a job before the cohort ended. He will also never write your resume for you or give you an answer directly, but you can expect the most detailed feedback you could ever imagine. He knows exactly what employers look for and will get you to where you need to be if you put in the work!

We've had several teachers and I have learnt a lot form all of them. Now I can develop a digital product end-to-end, I have acquired a handful lot of techniques and resources that I can apply to the projects I'll face in the future. Also I have learn the value of listening to your users and how failing early and testing often is vital to keep you in the game!
I have enjoyed the experience a lot, but I think that the thing I've liked most (and the thing I'll miss most) is the comradeship we've developed within this 2 months. We've leant on each other and we've learnt everything we could from one another.",12/18/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

He aprendido muchísimas cosas gracias a Iron Hack, ya sea el temario y aprender una filosofía tan buena de equipo y de trabajo.

Mi experiencia ha sido increíble, ya por mis compañeros, mis TA's, por el ambiente, también siento que en cierta manera me ha cambiado a mi, y me hace muy muy feliz.

Lo que más me ha gustado, sin duda, es la sensación familiar, el ver como empiezas tan perdido y acabas tan orgulloso de tu trabajo, que con esfuerzo y mucha dedicación, se puede sacar algo increíble.

As I love design in all its forms and wanted to get into the digital world, I got into the UX Bootcamp when I returned to Madrid, and I have discovered that the architecture and the world of the UX / UI have a lot to do!

The Ironhack experience has been incredible, not only for the amount of things we have learned but also for the human quality of the entire team (teachers, TAs and staff) and my colleagues. 
I have made many friends!

I have learned EVERYTHING.
Research and UX tools, design principles, typography and color palettes, to look for references and where to look for them ...
But above all methodologies and different ways of working, because we had 6 different teachers, each one a crack in their own way, and each taught us a different way of understanding the issues, focused on one point or another and taught you examples of the real world, so at all times we had contact with the world of work and what we were going to do next.

What I liked the most was without a doubt the people.
From Ironhack, camaraderie and teamwork are very much encouraged and then when it comes to work it shows and is wonderful.
The level of demand is high and we must take the final project forward in just 2 weeks! Working hand in hand with your colleagues not only helps you in many moments but also makes the experience more enjoyable.
Not only among the UX colleagues but also with the web ones. It is incredible to be proposing a project and to be able to talk to a programmer about the doubts that arise.

240527,2017.0,True,Exceptional,"I signed up for Ironhack wanting to go in a different direction in life, having previously worked in all sorts of different, not particularly creative jobs. In 9 weeks I went from very basic programming skills to being able to build a full web application with both front-end and back-end in modern respected technologies. You get out what you put in - the program is intense and ultimately the students who get the most are those who stay the latest and work the hardest.

Between the teachers, the other Ironhack students and the friendly office team the atmosphere was fantastic. Events were organised regularly to get to know different parts of the Tech sector and life as an engineer, as well as to party and have fun with other students - there are always an ample supply of beers available for students to enjoy after classes.

In terms of value, Ironhack was the best educational experience I've had (for comparison I have degrees from Oxford, University of Edinburgh, IE University in Madrid)

I received 5 interview job offers before the Ironhack hiring day the following week, and several more at the hiring day.  In terms of salary from low to high these were between a job as a front-end developer start-up in Barcelona for €20,000, a full stack engineer in an established international company in Barcelona at €30,000 a year or at a Dutch company in Amsterdam for €50,000. All with ample opportunities to learn.  In terms of working as a freelancer, I was also contacted by a UK agency offering 300GBP a day to work as a remote developer.  As I said above, I worked one of the highest in my cohort - those who put in similar efforts saw similar rewards though.

You'll learn skills which will help you your entire life, especially how to learn new technologies: in the four weeks after finishing I built applications with Ruby on Rails and Elixir/Phoenix, as well as using Javascript Libraries and frameworks I'd never even heard of during my time in Ironhack. 

Ironhack is not perfect. Don't come if you expect perfection; come to learn how to deal with real life situations. Sometimes the content is outdated --- just like happens in every programming job --- programming language change; sometimes things don't happen as expected; learn to deal with it. That's real life. The only thing I would say does not reflect real work is the lack of attention to testing. I don't think the importance of testing was impressed upon us - certainly in my cohort the one module that related to testing was treated as optional/an annoyance, and we were never taught principles of TDD or who to write a test. If it were up to me, I would have at least one of the portfolio projects have a small scope, but by developed through TDD. I think students would find more, and better paying jobs and ultimately be better developers because of it.",12/13/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

239986,2017.0,True,"When they say they can change your life, they mean it","I had initially been looking at Web Development bootcamps for about two years prior to finding Ironhack this was partly due to mixed articles about these kinds of programs as well as the technologies some of the programs taught. I had reached a point where I was tired of working stagnant retail and call center jobs, and wanted to see if I could really turn my hobby into a career.
Shortly after moving to Florida, I had been told about Ironhack from a friend and figured I may as well apply. Alia had contacted me back within about 15 minutes, and I was scheduled to come in a few days later. The interview process was not complicated, and the staff I spoke with did a great job of outlining the program. My biggest concern was that without having a college degree, and without any previous work experience, that a program like this still wouldn't help me, however Daniel Brito did a great job of explaining how to work around those things. I had also been doubting that I would have the bare minimum skill needed to pass the technical interview, which ended up going well (So don't doubt yourself on this!). 

    From the very first week, week 0, I decided I would start showing up to finish up some of the online prework that was assigned before the course started, this was the first time I met Kevin, on of the TAs, who was very friendly, and had a manner of encouraging learning without just handing you answers. 

    After the first week started our primary instructor Nizar gave us a run down of what our schedule was going to look like, and I'll admit it was intimidating. Nizar however, had a manner of teaching that made the fact that we were learning a LOT more enjoyable than stressful. In addition to that, the TAs Kevin and Ariel both out host break-out sessions throughout the week to focus on different concepts that some were struggling with, and held these sessions in a way that students would also be able to participate. To compliment the technical side of learning the skills needed to become a software developer, Daniel Brito also regularly would teach us the Ins-and-Outs of the career side: Networking skills, community events, resume building, etc. and this was something that was very unique and welcomed. I had expected this to be like most traditional schools where they will teach you skills and concepts, but will leave you on your own when it comes to getting employed for those skills. This also brought about the possibility of learning beyond the scope of the Ironhack curriculum, as we were actively encouraged to attend events and meet people in the tech scene who were established developers, entrepreneurs and startup founders who also were willing to share their knowledge, some working in the same building as Ironhack was located. 
    Now with all those ""pros"" being said, it should be noted that while not exactly a ""con"" there are some things to keep in mind: They call this a bootcamp, and that is a very accurate word to describe it. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either. Unlike traditional schooling, you wont get a degree for simply showing up and goofing off. We had to do projects that applied everything we learned, and the time given to complete these project was 1 week, and then they had to be presented to both the class, and occasionally other people who were in the building. Before Ironhack, I had written some scripts and small programs for fun, but they were never seen by anyone, and now I had to not only show it to my instructors, but to several people?! It stands as one of the most stressful things that I would gladly do again. What was great about this though is that it conditions you for what is expected of you in the industry, and by the end, these presentations were more fun than stressful. 

Ultimately Ironhack teaches you how to stand on your own in a relatively new and rapidly changing industry, and teaches you how to continue teaching yourself long after you leave the program, so that your skills will stay competitive. Nizar is a master of both writing code, and teaching it. Kevin and Ariel were great at encouraging us when we got stuck or stressed out, and also making things fun. Daniel Brito will make you into a rockstar when it comes to networking, job hunting, and building a presence for yourself in the tech community of your choice. Thanks to the well crafted curriculum, and the great staff, I've now gone from a guy who had moved from working in aerospace to working at grocery stores and call centers, who wrote simple programs on the weekend for fun, to a Full Stack .Net Developer at a company who's 2 week development sprints are a walk in the park compared to the 1 week high-pressure sprints for Ironhack's projects.

The online courses will teach you a lot but there's one and the biggest advantage of live word and that is - that’s able to teach you to develop not just your skills but your mindset as well. Speaking about that, the best thing for me was getting the ability to learn how to actually learn to code and how to find good resources which gives me opportunity to gain new skill sets now on my own.
The people working in Ironhack are super friendly and always available to meet you on any way - to share their knowledge, their experiences and their resources with us.

239950,2016.0,True,An Entry to Software Engineering on the Web,"I first heard about Ironhack because I lived close to their Miami campus and saw they were having a workshop on HTML/CSS. I had done some basic web dev back in school but hadn't touched it in years. Being in the classroom for the workshop brought back all the fun I had in initially building awful looking myspace pages and the like using only a laptop. I was hooked.

I soon applied for the full-stack web bootcamp, leaving a good job at the time because I knew this bootcamp would take me in the direction I wanted to go. I wanted to be able to build applications to help my teams and clients, and knew that I had enough curiosity and perseverance to actually likely make it happen.

This bootcamp is no walk in the park. I quit my job, didn't go out with friends, and focused as much of my energy as humanly possible on grasping the changing concepts. Each day we had a morning lesson, exercises, an afternoon lesson, and then a night project. While instructors did help those in the class that were falling behind, the class moves fast and you have to give it your all to progress. The instructors were not only an intelligent, hardworking group, they took care of each question that came about, and often stayed after hours to help with projects, going far above and beyond. The classmates were a driven bunch. It was exciting seeing each person, coming from vastly different backgrounds, excelling and struggling at different stages.

After the bootcamp, we all make one final application during a 2 week sprint, and then present these to Ironhack and the community, a group of maybe 80-100. Afterwards networking happens and then its on you! 

I found a full stack web developer role a few months after graduation, through a recruiter friend of mine from back home. This did require me moving back to Philadelphia from Miami, which was a little sad but it is a reality. Please don't assume that you will immediately find a job right where you studied, you may have to pick up and move to find something!

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Ironhack experience. You will learn the basics of full stack web development. You will learn how to make real, production applications. You'll learn about the nuances that are in modern web development, and learn what you need to learn next. If you work hard enough, you will be able to convince hiring managers that you are now an entry level software engineer.",11/22/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

A few articles later,I took a gut guided decision to actually take my chance and applied on the spot to 3 different bootcamp across Europe, completely impervious to the life altering consequences this ""Why not?""gave rise to.

After following classes online for a while, I decided to attend a bootcamp to deep-dive into it. Here, you'll think, talk, breathe and even dream code for 2 months. In my opinion, there is no better way to learn than this. It's a lot of work, but it's well worth the effort.

The best thing about Ironhack is by far the teachers: they're always available with great advice, tips. And most of all, they have an amazing capacity to explain even the most complex concepts in terms that anyone can understand.

If you're looking for a way to immerse yourself into web development, then this is a great choice for sure. The technologies you'll learn are state-of-the-art, and a great entry point into this career path.
Now that the course ended, I'm currently interviewing for a variety of roles spanning from Frontend/Fullstack/Backend dev to growth engineering to project/product management. I'm confident this will lead to an interesting new career.

Don't forget to do prework before joining IronHack bootcamp , its really useful. It makes your life easier during the initial lessons.

I was amazed how many everyone in my group learnt and did after the first project, and now -  after the end of the bootcamp - I'm really impressed about how many we practiced and learnt.

239682,2017.0,True,Great Curriculum + Outstanding Teachers &amp; Staff + Super Cohort = Amazing Experience,"This really was an outstanding experience on so many levels!

First, IronHack makes sure the curriculum is in synch with the latest developments in the tech industry (think ES6, Vue.js, Bootsrtrap etc.) so you end up with skills that are relevant on the market.

As a matter of fact, a bootcamp is very intense, so be prepared for a rough ride, with much knowledge to absorb, a good dose of frustration and a few doubting moments to overcome. True, the learning process is exhilarating at times and painful at other, but always keep the faith that with time and practice you will progress, understand and succeed. 

A bootcamp can fit many profiles from total newbies (as the former me) to people with some knowledge of computer science or that have already dabbled with programming. Hence, our cohort was quite heterogeneous in terms of levels and goals, but it created a healthy emulation where co-students and assistants were always supportive to students that were most challenged.

Ultimately, as a student I am amazed by how much we have learned and achieved in a span of only 9 weeks. Yet, it is also very humbling to realise that there is still so much more to learn and that some advanced topics are just out of the reach of jr. devs. One thing I realised as well, is that programming is a craftsmanship that requires hours upon hours of practice and hands-on experience and no one can become a programmer overnight. Nevertheless, a bootcamp is simply the perfect kick-starter that will provide you with the basic skillset to be able to learn by yourself. 
Note that If your goal is to be recruited as a jr. dev after the bootcamp, which ws not my case, I strongly recommend that you enter the bootcamp as much prepared as possible (do online tutorials, watch YT vids, check as many resources as possible etc.).

In a nutshell, I can assert that thanks to IronHack I have grown from code illiterate to code literate, which is truly life-changing.

Hats off to the staff for, although we were only the second Parisian cohort, the bootcamp was already a fine-tuned machine very well connected with the French tech ecosystem. 
A very special mention to the teaching staff (teachers and assistants) who were extremely skilled and whose dedication was just out of this world...

En cuanto a contar de Ironhack, la verdad que sólo puedo decir cosas buenas, el equipo es una maravilla, ha sido mi familia en Madrid durante estos dos meses y siempre dispuestos a echar una mano con cualquier cosa; en cuanto al curso, genial, empiezas la primera semana poco a poco y cuando te quieres dar cuenta, estas luchando contra el último proyecto, con unos conocimientos, ¡que parece que llevo programando 3 años (mínimo)! 
La experiencia, mejor que bien, de verdad, es que me ha cambiado la vida ""radicalmente"" en dos meses y medio, llegue a Ironhack con miedo en pleno Agosto, y ahora en noviembre llevo 2 semanas trabajando de desarrolladora FullStack, confiaba en Ironhack, pero no pensé que sería tan rápido.
Y en cuanto a lo que he aprendido, mucho, ya no sólo he aprendido JS y a todos sus amigos, si no que también he aprendido a seguir investigando, y así puedo seguir formándome yo sola, que en el mundo tecnologico, o te renuevas cada día o te oxidas, y eso lo he aprendido allí con vosotros.",11/19/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

Nizar is one of the two best teachers I've ever had and I have been in school for way too long.The effort he puts in is admirable and motivating.

Kevin and Gus were very kind, helpful and ego-boosting TAs and I appreciate them immensely.

The Ironhack staff is amazing, Alia and Marisa, you two are integral to the success of one of the best bootcamps worldwide.

Brito is a really awesome guy, he truly cares and he will do his best for you. And he has some quotes that you will remember your whole life.

I was hired as a developer after the course and this would not have been possible without Ironhack. 

A fair word of warning however: you must dedicate yourself entirely and you must love programming. You will have to go above and beyond what is taught in class to be competitive in the job market. And once you have finished these two months, you will realize how much there is left to learn; it never ends, so be prepared and make sure this is your passion.

Horacio was a really great guy, but overall I don't think he added much value to the class. One of the best parts of Ironhack was getting to know my classmates to whom I still speak almost daily. Brito was such a champion for our class and making sure everyone landed a job, I'm very grateful for that. I think Ironhack really gave me the skills to start a career as a UX designer, however, I don't feel the course covered UI very well.",11/17/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,4.3,[],5.0,3.0,5.0,ironhack
239721,2017.0,True,"If you want to learn to code, go to the other guys. If you want to become a developer, come to Ironhack.","After giving joining a coding camp much thought, I decided to pull the trigger and join Ironhack’s Full-time Web Development Cohort (Miami) in January of 2017 and I must say it one of the best decisions that I have made to date. I enrolled with the intent to only further my skills as a developer and put myself in a better position to enter the market as a professional but I walked away with so much more.

Anyone throwing around the idea of joining a coding bootcamp has to do their due diligence and really be sure that they get all the information they can on the camp before committing. So as an alumni I am putting myself back in the shoes of a prospective student and will shed light into some of the pressing questions that are sure to be on the mind.

Investment: Any coding camp is going to be a sizeable investment in not only money but time as well. Anyone who is toying with the idea of getting into coding and has not yet attempted to learn on their own is running the risk of losing on this investment. A prospective student should be absolutely sure that a coding camp is the right choice for them because the last thing you want to do is be tippy toeing around the idea of a life as a developer only to have gone through the bootcamp and realize that maybe it wasn’t all that you built it up to be in your mind. Look at all of the free resources (Google, YouTube, etc.) and at least attempt to learn on your own beforehand. A career in development is one that involves life long learning so I have to emphasize that you ask yourself if you are considering this bootcamp for the right reasons (i.e. genuine love for development and not the money chase).

Curriculum: Ironhack is constantly keeping an eye on market trends with regards to the skills employers want in to see in Junior Developers. In 2017 they decided to take the web development curriculum from one that was Ruby centric to one that teaches Full Stack Web Development (MEAN) with Javascript. This right here is big because it makes you  more attractive in the eyes of potential employees as the demand for these skills high and you are given the foundation to go off and build the next big application or at the very least understand how the most popular applications (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) are built.

Course Instruction: Nizar Khalife (Lead Instructor for full time Web Development course) is an experienced developer with real world experience who has a wealth of knowledge and is more than willing to share it if you are willing to receive it. He Knows the material like the back of his hand and you are going to wish that you had more than 9 weeks to pick his brain to extract all of his wisdom.

Career Placement: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager) is someone who you need to have as a professional contact as he knows just about everyone in the Miami Tech scene. He worked many years as a Senior IT recruiter so he knows exactly what employers are looking for in Junior Developers.  He is also someone who will bend over backwards for you by not only placing employers in front of you but will also show you how to hustle your way into generating quality leads for yourself. His career services are invaluable and are not to be underutilized.  

Networking: Aside from technical skills, there is networking aspect that launches you right into the heart of the Miami Tech scene. Ironhack has been able to build relationships with major companies and industry leaders that you can easily leverage once you are a member of the Ironhack family; student or alumni. If landing a job as a developer after taking the course is your goal (which it should be), skill alone will not get your foot in the door (unless you are gifted with genius level abilities). You also have to network and make yourself be known in the eyes of the community and Ironhack is your ticket into it.

Daniel Brito and Nizar Khalife are invaluable resources that make Ironhack what it is and make worth the cost of the bootcamp. However, they are not alone in making Ironhack the machine that it is. The rest of the staff are an absolute joy and you will never feel like you are just another dollar in the pockets of another organization. Everyone is extremely hands on and will go above and beyond to ensure that your experience is one that promotes your success.

In my eyes, Ironhack is by far the best coding camp in South Florida that provides you will all the tools and resources needed to get a return on your investment.",11/17/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
239722,2017.0,True,One of the Best Personal Decisions for my Life by Far,"I will say that attending Ironhack’s 9 Week Web Development Course has been one of the best personal decisions for my life by far. This is not an exaggeration. I chose computer engineering as my major in college to make my parents proud; however, computer engineers are about signals and circuitry, and I could not see myself pursuing a career revolving around this. I spent 2 years stumbling to find a passion, and eventually, I found it in coding.

As a disclaimer, prior to the bootcamp, I gain some coding experience from college, and while unemployed, I attempted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics through online resources, but I felt like my learning was sporadic and unstructured. I attempted to apply for programming jobs for six months, but after about 90 job applications, no one reached out to me. I felt discouraged, but I knew I needed to find guidance. Ironhack provided this guidance.

The 9-week course was fast-paced even for a person with some coding background, so I strongly encourage students with no experience to learn basic JavaScript prior to the start date. The teacher, Nizar, was able to break down complex concepts into simple examples and analogies making them easier to understand. He also provided step-by-step implementation for web application examples. Each day, there are periodic breaks between lessons, so he and the TA can assist us throughout the class; therefore, everyone remains on the same page.

The three projects at the end of each module were great opportunities for all of us to shine. I felt proud of my projects since the ideas came from myself, and I was the one (with some existence) who needed to break them down into coding solutions. Having a project at the end of each module helped solidify the skill sets learned in the current section and build on the previous skills. These projects were done in a short span of time (as short as one week) forcing us to learn project management skills.

I had one issue that frustrated me and other students during project week. The length spent troubleshooting problems for individual students were far too long. Sometimes one student would take one or two hours of the teacher’s time fixing a feature while there was a queue of other students waiting for assistance. Because of this, during the final project week, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues on my own, and I was unable to complete most of the features in my project.

After graduation, career week followed, and those seven days were very helpful. I learned strategies for job hunting, and I realized that those six months of no-follow-up job hunting was due to poor tactics. Our advisor, Brito, made sure to have multiple companies at our hiring fair. The hiring fair reminded me of speed dating where you only had twenty minutes per company! It was stressful and excited at the same time. From this hiring fair, I received 3 interviews, and I got an offer 2 weeks later. I am now an associate software engineer making twice as much money as I did a year ago, and honestly, I am excited about my career path as a developer.",11/17/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

I can't say enough good things about Nizar. He is an absolutely amazing instructor, very patient, kind, and gives his all to ensure all of his students are successful. He will never abandon you when you're truly stuck, and sit with you and make sure you understand. He is also genuinely hilarious which helps a lot when learning how to code. I am very grateful to Nizar, he helped me so much throughout the duration of the course.

Our TA,  Kevin was also very wonderful. He worked very hard to keep up with all of our questions. Even when he wasn't sure of the answer he sat there and would work together with you to figure it out. He also wasn't afriad to leave us to figure things out on our own when he knew we were capable. I appreciated that. Sometimes we also had Dapper Dan as our TA, he was also super helpful. 

The staff at Ironhack is great, everyone is very kind and friendly. You really get that feeling of famiy while you are there. 

Brito, our Placements Manager is also equally amazing. He really does make himself fully available to you to help you get a job. Just to be clear, he's NOT there to do all of the job-hunting work.

The instructor, Nizar, was well prepared and knowledgeable about all the topics shared during the boot camp, and whenever somebody didn't understand something without thinking it twice he will stand right next to you and explained it, making sure that you fully understand it before moving to another topic. 

The IronHack staff was amazing and very friendly, at the point that going to IronHack really felt like going to visit your loved ones.

Daniel got your back. There are only 3 things you have to do in order to succeed and get a job in this field right after graduation:  

1 - Listen to Daniel! He will give you very important info that will help you not only to find a job in this field but to get a job in any field.

2 - Work hard! I will go to IronHack and spend 7 -  8 hours coding and as soon as I got home, I would continue working on projects and going over all the lectures.

3 - Practice practice and practice! IronHack will give you the all the tools and knowledge that you would need to start a career in this field but if you don't practice and put the hard work now, later on, it won't get any easier and you need to create a ""practice & study"" discipline and routine.

Before I joined Ironhack, I was worried that no matter how hard I worked, I wouldn't be prepared because maybe the curriculum was teaching the wrong skills, maybe the bootcamp didn't have strong business relationships in the community. 

I was proven wrong. Ironhack has far exceeded my expectations.

The Instructor
Our instructor in Miami was Nizar. This guy will go above and beyond to make sure you understand everything that is being taught.

I learned from him in 9 weeks what would've took me a whole year to do by myself. He will spot bugs in your code so quickly it'll make you feel stupid. But this is good, because he will get you from point A to point B much faster. He's half the reason why you're paying $10,000. 

The more questions you ask, the more you bug Nizar before class and after class with questions, the more you'll understand, and the more money's worth you'll get from this bootcamp. And Nizar will always be willing to help.

The Placements Manager
This is where the other half of your money is going. If you put in the work, this man will get you a job. They call him the plug in the Miami tech community, but we call him Brito. 

During my cohort, this man managed to invite 17 companies to the hiring fair. Not only that, he's got connections in tech companies you've never even heard of. He works his ass off for you to get a job. And that's exactly what you want. 

He'll help you with your resume, on your job search, on building a network, on getting to the right person in the right company... Anything you can think of during the job search, this man got you covered. 

The Staff
Everyone at Ironhack is on your team. Everyone is family there. Anything you need, they got your back. 

The most impressive thing to me is how they ask for your feedback on the class every single week. They sit down with you if you have any compliants and they really make you feel like they care. 

I believe that with every year, each cohort will get better and better.

Warnings before you apply:
No one is there to hold your hand. If you slack off, no one gives a damn. You're just competition to everyone else in your class for the same jobs. 

If you join, make sure you love to code. Make sure you're willing to commit at minimum 12 hours a day to the bootcamp. Make sure you're willing to continue to work without anyone looking over your shoulder.

If you join, aim to be in the top 10% of the class. That's the only way you'll be in demand. 

Do the pre-work. Master the basics, and get a head start in the class. 

Built connections with people. Go to events, speak up at talks, ask great questions. The connections you build in this cohort will last you a lifetime. 

Ironhack changed my life, and if I knew how much value they provided, I would've gladly paid double for the tuition. 

Ironhack gives you the opportunity to be rewarded for your hard work. And you will be rewarded.

In order to be as useful as I can I will describe my personal experience. I arrived to Ironhack from a completely different background, having studied Law and Business. I first delved into the world of computer programming a few months before, but there seemed to be too much material and no structure. It was then that I found this bootcamp.

What do I value most of Ironhack:

1. Their course is designed to empower you, and teach you to teach yourself programming. Ironhack gives you the means to learn by yourself.
2. The course is very particularized, and you are given support and close feedback. After all, they have a ratio of 1 teacher for every 8 iron hackers.
3. The iron hack community. Ironhack is an experience which transcends education and it certainly does not finish after the bootcamp ends. Not only does it offer a hiring week, increasing the probability of finding a job, but you form a growing community of Ironhackers, with extensive knowledge in all areas of software development.

Beware, It is no an easy experience. In the 9-week-long course you will face frustration in all its shapes and forms. However, would it be worth it if it wasn’t so demanding? If you are tired of your job,  are thinking about learning software development, or starting your own business, Ironhack gives you a head start in an industry which is growing increasingly year after year.

It is an experience which transcends education,  in which the student is given support in every sense.  Sure it is a tough experience. But would it be worth it if it wasn't?

239320,2017.0,True,Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp - Read For Details!,"I graduated from the full-time Web Development (Miami) cohort in October 2017, and I had a very positive experience overall. Here’s the TL;DR of my review of Ironhack in bullet points, but I highly encourage you to read the rest of the post if you’re considering attending this bootcamp and want to get an unfiltered and real opinion from a recent grad who now works full-time as a Software Engineer.

First and foremost, if you’re going to go into the web dev program, it absolutely has to be because you feel genuinely passionate about this field and working as a developer one day. If you’re doing this for money, you’re doing it for the wrong reason and at some point during the program you will realize you hate what you’re doing and you wasted $11K.

Daniel Brito (placements manager) and Nizar Khalife (head instructor for the full-time class) are absolute gold and two people you will learn a ridiculous amount of great things from. Without a doubt, these two guys alone are worth the cost of the Bootcamp and, quite frankly, without them Ironhack Miami wouldn’t be as solid. Listen to them, let them guide you, they do know what they’re doing. The rest of the staff are also very nice and friendly people.

Remember that no bootcamp is some sort of magical experience — the end result and your overall success in it really boils down to the amount of effort that you put in. And you have to put in more effort than probably any other endeavor you’ve taken on in your life. This is no exaggeration. 

Everyone’s lives are different, but do whatever you can to enroll in the full-time cohort and not the part-time. Doing this stuff full-time ensures you will be significantly more focused and with less distractions. Trust me, this is critical.
To elaborate some more, Ironhack is a great experience that will without a doubt push you to your limits and make you feel outside your comfort zone almost constantly. This is a good thing, and it also means that the more passionate you are about being a developer, the more you will learn and the less frustrated you will feel when you don’t understand something. One way to know if you enjoy doing this stuff every day is to prep yourself before you decide to enroll (lots of free resources out there, Google it). You do that by making a daily schedule (as in, 5-7 days a week) where you spend at least a few hours each day learning to code and problem solve using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on your own. Keep this up for a few weeks and you’ll get a better idea as to whether this is something you’d enjoy doing as a full-time job or not. If you walk into Ironhack with that level of commitment, you will definitely do well and you will also get along super well with Brito and Nizar. 

Brito in particular is someone who knows almost everyone in the tech community in South Florida, and he's also a great guy to talk to. He’s the person who will bend over backwards for you to help you find a job, help you grow your professional network, and give you all sorts of actually useful advice (no fluff or BS) on anything from job hunting, to résumé building, to how to talk to potential employers. But this is only going to happen if you’re dead serious about the program and finding a job afterwards. He is NOT there to do the work for you, you first gotta put in the effort, you gotta hustle, and you gotta love what you’re doing. 

Nizar is the one other person you want to listen to and learn from. The man has a substantial amount of real developer experience and the ability to almost glance at a problem and tell you what’s wrong with your code and what you can do to fix it. He’s also extremely patient and very good at helping you understand abstract concepts. Overall a fantastic instructor.

All in all, this is the best bootcamp in South Florida, by a long shot. Ultimately, it’s up to you and no one else how successful you are in the program and whether you find a job at some point later. Brito and Nizar are priceless.

My advice to future students would be: prepare to say good bye to your social life for eight weeks, but also prepare to enjoy. The syllabus is compelling and work oriented, the teachers are fully dedicated, and hopefully you´ll meet people as amusing and interesting as I did. 

And last but not least: Ironhack´s staff will get you in touch with people and companies working in the field during the last week´s hiring event so you will hit the ground running.

239203,2017.0,True,Strongly Recommend,"I approached this course in the same way that I approach life: with skepticism. If you are in a similar position, I recommend that you consider making the investment in the course.

I entered the course thinking I was not a social person. However in this classroom, I was surrounded by a subset of likeminded people who were interested in bettering themselves. The environment is supportive, motivating, and, honestly, fun. Nizar was my instructor for the Miami Web Development cohort. He is kind, intelligent, and a truly gifted educator. He has the ability to meet you at the point in a process where you begin to lack understanding and adapt his explanation in a way that best suits each student.

Brito’s guidance through the subtle nuances of negotiating employment in this field was invaluable. To my shock/horror, in tech your skillset alone will not get you the best job. It’s who you know and how they see you in terms of your personality, drive, and ability to learn (for which your skillset serves as evidence). Through his preparation, I was able to make contacts, secure interviews and perform in those interviews with a higher level of comfort and composure.

Post Ironhack, I received several job offers, and I accepted a position at a company that cares about its employees and fosters growth from within. I have a fundamental understanding that will allow me to continue learning and sculpt my skillset to fit any area that catches my interest.

But the most surprising thing was the number of job offers that I was able to apply with my new profile: ""Ironhack UX / UI Designer"".

After these almost 3 months, I can say that this is a great plan for any undergrad’s summer.

It’s tremendously hard, but it does pay off! Now in the tech courses at uni I’ve noticed a great advantage and I’m also working on developing my bootcamp’s final project.

I was a business controller two years ago and even though I liked numbers there was something missing, it wasn’t ringing the right bell. So I thought of what I really enjoyed and what I was good at and also what challenges I would have liked. I had some small programming knowledge related to my nerdy childhood and expanding it and making a life out if it sounded like a dream, then it became my plan. I started Ironhack with a strong will but not a final idea of what I could do with it. From day 1 it has been 360 degrees full-on experience. Every day there was an awesome tech event that I wouldn’t want to miss, technical challenges that I wanted to conquer and a bunch of like-minded people that made everything so fun and enjoyable, even the long nights before delivering the projects. I was lucky that Ironhack became my family away from home, both my colleagues, the teachers and the staff.

I was the one studying non-stop but the teachers directed my struggles in the right way, showing me how I should work and where I should focus and help me when I felt lost. I tried studying online on my own before the boot camp but I never got near an inch of the results I got out of the course. I gave it my best and I got the same in return. Ironhack taught me a lot about perseverance, and how to solve problems and code bugs in a way that I couldn’t have thought of it before. It made me push through a lot of documentation and it was just what I needed to learn and to be able to improve and learn on my own after the course. Ironhack showed me where and how the magic happens and taught me how to make some myself and I can’t wait to see just how far I’ll go from here.",10/6/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

238508,2017.0,True,A highlight in my life,"Just today someone asked me to draw a graph with an X axis from 0 to my age and a Y axis with 0 to 10, where 0 was the complete worst and 10 was the best.  Then I had to draw two lines: one on my happiness level and one on my achievement level overall my life. 

When I was drawing the lines, the period I was in the bootcamp was one of the most fulfilling periods in my life, really close to 10, both in happiness and personal achievement. I had to work my ass off to get in, because it is not cheap, and I risked a lot by joining: if it failed I would have been in the shit. But it passed with flying colours. 

The stack you learn (MEAN) is really good, the materials were really good and comprehensive. The course is REALLY REALLY HARD. Very high paced, even if you have previous experience. So you'll get frustrated, tired, crazy. I would have liked to learn React more than Angular, but still it was good. Two of the teachers my cohort had were really good, and the third one was mindblowing, but we only had him for a week :( Overall, they were really good, patient and always willing to help, but they have to cover a looooooot of content in a really short time, so it is difficult for them, as they can not take the time they would like to to go over some concepts.

More than the teachers, for me the incredible part was the other students, the teacher assistants and some other people from the staff. For me, the TAs are the real heroes here. They do the grunt work, they handle our complaints, frustrations, limitations, help us with code and with handling the pressure. And the colleagues I had, I have only love for them. They were all amazing, driven, empathetic, funny people. I miss them a lot. 

At one point, a crazy CEO with a biotech startup came into my bootcamp looking for developers. I really, really wanted that job, but they were not looking for juniors. I persisted, and at some point they sent me this crazy technical test in Groovy and Grails, that I had never heard of before. I managed, and not only because of my effort, but because my friends there, the TAs and some other staff members encouraged me so much. I felt so supported and so happy. If I had tried that alone, I would have given up. So yes, I got the job one week before my final project, and here I am, in a biotech startup in London as I wanted.

And all because I was there with that big 'family', where I was able to achieve way more than I could normally achieve. They make you believe in yourself, in your abilities. Also that has a special value if you are a woman in tech. They push you a lot, the contents are too much and you think you can not manage, but you feel so comfortable that you end up managing. You grow like crazy in such a short period of time you don't even believe it was possible. 

I can not guarantee that your experience there will be as fulfilling as mine. I consider myself extremely lucky with all the amazing people that converged in my cohort. But if you don't get a community as excellent, at least the technical knowledge you'll gather will be really solid and good. You'll gain or improve the abilities of sharing, helping, communicating, dealing with frustration, solving problems. And they really help you with intros and contacts if you want them, it shouldn't be too difficult to get a job after the bootcamp.

If I had been asked 9 weeks ago to explain the processes that go into creating a website, I would not know where to begin. Now, I can create a full stack web application.

The curriculum is dense and it can be intimidating for a  beginner. But by the end, you will have enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to start your own projects and learn new tools using their respective documentation.

The instructors are intelligent and passionate about the course material. Therefore, they are able to break down complicated topics in a way that is easy for beginners to understand. The teaching assistants make themselves available to help students past the hours of the bootcamp. 

The staff that work at Ironhack are friendly and are always working hard to make sure students get the best the most out of their time with Ironhack. We had many organized talks from experts on topics including: machine learning, legal start-up advice, and how venture capitalists make investment decisions. This was a benefit of the course that I didn't see beforehand but made the program that much more valuable.

238293,2016.0,True,A community of superstars,"I attended the Ironhack Part-time Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid. An intense 6-month zero-to-hero program for anyone wanting to open their mind to the exciting world of web development.

My initial knowledge of the technology stack in the curriculum was basically null, but I was starting a position as Software Engineer at an up-and-coming startup in Madrid, and I needed to learn as much as I could as fast as I could. Ironhack proved to be just the right thing for me. For the sake of organizing the review, I'd like to split it in three parts: the Curriculum, the Experience, and the Staff.

1. The Curriculum
I do not want to get too deep into this because it has changed quite a bit since I did the course. My class was the last of the Ruby on Rails Generation. Nonetheless, the course was generic and conceptual enough that using other technologies, such as Node.js in my case at work, proved to be quite easy. They have since changed their curriculum to Node.js, which is a great idea in my opinion. You will come out having a broad enough knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to tackle the coolest web-dev projects you find on Github and, as well as a great notion on working with databases. You will definitely have the skillset necessary to build your own projects from scratch as well. I think the best way to define the learning process at Ironhack is that you gain the ability to explore and master the tools you need to build a web application. The stack they may use is no limiting factor.  In essence, you get the wings you need to fly on your own through the web-dev universe.

2. The Experience
It's intense. Even the part-time  plan is challenging and demanding. For 6 months you will have to be strongly committed to the course, because how much you learn will depende entirely on you. Ironhack will provide the tools you need to get as far as you want to go, but the effort has to be there. The pacing is neither too fast, nor too slow, although you do have to work at home a bit if you want to keep up. If you come from a totally different background, or are writing your first lines of code, you'll probably need to work harder than people who are more familiar with code. But fear not, you will have awesome support from your classmates and teachers.  You will be spending two days from 18 to 21, and Saturdays from 9 to 17 at Ironhack, so be prepared. Balancing the course with a full time job and your personal life is definitely possible, but you will certainly need the willpower to do it. The structure has changed since I did the course, I believe now it is more project based (three projects in total), and at the end you get to share your creations with your mates and with people from all over the community that come to the Hackshow. 

3. The community
This is, in my opinion, the greatest value in Ironhack. You will make great friends with your teachers, you will make great friends with your classmates, and will live an amazing experience carefully crafted by the entirety of the Ironhack team. You will be connected to the community before, during and after the course. There will be lunches, dinners, parties, hackshows, hackathons, talks and so much more to make the Ironhack experience that much more enriching. Every member of the Ironhack family, not just the teachers, is there to make the most of the program for the students, and it really shows. Also the space they have in Madrid is beautiful, making it a pleasure to go there work and spend time.

Overall a great experience that I thoroughly recommend to anyone that want to dig into the world of app-building - whether you are thinking of a cool project, want a career change, or work in product and want to understand what the devs at your work do. Ironhack is sure to satisfy your curiosity.",10/3/2017,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
238437,2017.0,True,Can't recommend this course enough,"I found Ironhack about 6 months after finishing undergrad. At the time, I was preparing to go to law school, but once I realized it wasn’t the right fit I had to re-group and figure out my next steps. I was working a very boring job in retail for about 8 months before Ironhack, so obviously I was eager to get started. 

I did a ton of research before committing. Needless to say, for many prospective students it can be daunting to put a pause on your career to take a risk on a bootcamp that may or may not live up to your expectations. In my first two rounds of interviews, Alia and Marisa immediately quelled these anxieties. The amount of care that the Ironhack staff puts into each cohort is unrivaled. Something I really admire about them is that they’re always working to improve the next cohort based on what they learned from the last group. 

The course was split up into the steps of the design thinking process, with a new instructor each week. 1 design sprint, 1 group project and 2 solo projects. This stood out to me in comparison to other design programs because it gives you the opportunity to show off the work you can do on your own as well as what you can contribute to a team. At one point you’ll be working on two projects at once (group and individual), but it’s very manageable. (My advice would be to document everything along the way via Medium posts so that you’re not scrambling at the end to put together your portfolio.) Our TA Horacio was always available to help us through any road blocks we hit along the way. Your cohort will be your greatest support system and will challenge you to work harder and smarter. 
 
For hiring week, Brito gave us a choice of 15 employers to interview with. It’s up to you to choose the companies you want to sit down with, but I would highly recommend interviewing with as many as possible. Not because you’ll get a job out of the hiring fair, but because the interview practice you’ll get is an invaluable experience. Don’t worry about wasting the time of employers that you’re not serious about because several of the companies that came in during our hiring fair immediately told us they weren’t hiring. Regardless, the experience made me a pro at interviewing and gave me the confidence I needed to succeed in my interviews that followed. 

Even if you don’t get hired immediately, Brito makes it his mission to get you a job. I really appreciated all his support and advice throughout the job search process. He’ll help you through the gritty details of negotiating offers, writing follow up emails, and anything else you need to know along the way. He’s an invaluable resource, listen to him! 

I accepted an offer 3 weeks after my program ended. I couldn’t have done it without the support and care of Alia, Marisa, Danny, Brito, Horacio, and the rest of the amazing staff, instructors, and TAs at Ironhack. That said, you will not get a job just by taking this course. Work hard and listen to the advice from Brito, your instructors, your mentors, and even your classmates. 

“If you’re empathetic by nature, and you have a head for problem solving, along with a thorough understanding of general design principles and processes, a healthy combination of functional and aesthetic sensibilities, a willingness to learn, and you enjoy the work, there’s absolutely no reason you can’t quit your shit job as soon as possible, so that you might do what you were really born to do.”",10/3/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
238412,2017.0,True,Web Dev Part-time,"As a sophomore college student pursuing a Computer Science degree, I joined Ironhack with the purpose of fast-forwarding my start as a programmer, and that way I would get some real experience while finishing school. The course was really intense. Every class we would go over a different topic, but first half an hr of class was dedicated to go over the homework, and at the end of each module (the course was divided into 3 modules/units), we would have a review of the whole unit and a project in which we would implement what we learned. The Ironhack staff is the nicest! They are friendly, with a great energy, and encourage you to success! Building facilities were great! They're 24/7 open, so during project week my classmates and I would stay until very late coding and helping each other, and we as a group got really together, even though our cohort finished almost 2 months ago, we still stay in contact! The people you meet here are truly special, full of drive, and seeing all of them working full-time jobs, studying and barely sleeping staying coding after midnight is really inspiring. Our TA Nick was THE BEST! There's one day when he even slept over at Building just to help us with our projects! Brito, the Placement Manager was awesome!

238290,2017.0,True,Great experience with web development bootcamp with Ironhack! I created my first webapp in 9 weeks while I didn't know anything about coding at the starting point.,"I decided to join Ironhack web development bootcamp for several reasons and I didn't regret my choice and was even more satisfied than what I expected.
I had 2 objectives: I wanted to learn how to code so as to start my own business, I wanted to connect to the tech environment.
Both objectives were reached and even more I hadn't expected!

Here are the main advantages of this program to me:
- We learnt the latest technologies and at the end of the bootcamp were able to develop our own webapp and received all the elements to be able to go on learning more languages and 
- The program is not only about getting the material read and going through the exercices one by one: the team is super involved in fine-tuning it to the rythm of the students and is flexible to make sure everyone keeps on board. There are several teacher assistants and we can easily ask for help.
- There are many add-ons to the coding training that are super valuable: weekly meeting with people from the tech environment (entrepreneurs, developpers, recruiters...), activities during the bootcamp...
- The team is great and is dedicated to make the experience unique and the atmosphere is very friendly and nice.
The program is quite expensive but I think it worth the investment. It's not easy, but you never get great results from easy experiences.",9/27/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
238278,2017.0,True,Take your career to the next level with this UX/UI Design Program,"Before starting the UX/UI Design course with Ironhack I had a comfortable job. You know one of those come to work, do your job, don't ask any hard questions, grab lunch, go to a meeting or two. I was comfortable, but wasn't fullfilled. I knew I had to make a move to puruse a life that I really wanted, possibly in the fastest amount of time possible.​

I had experience within the UX/UI design field prior to my comfortable job, I took on a few freelance jobs as side income, but I wasn't anywhere near able to puruse a full UX/UI career. I needed to add to my portfolio, tighten up my design skills, and meet more people in the industry.

I knew I needed further education, but the question was what program or school could offer the results I needed in the fastest amount of time possible? Before I make any big decisions I research the heck out of everything, comparing, contrasting, emailing past clients or students in this case, and asking everyone I could on what they thought of the program I would be spending a good chunk of money on. I researched design programs in Atlanta, Chicago, and Texas, speaking with their advisors and asking a multitude of questions. None though were as genuine, honest, and optmistic as Alia Poonawala from Ironhack. I placed my application on a Monday morning, she called me the following Tuesday morning, requesting I come into a meeting later that day. She answered all my questions, even allowing me to briefly meet Daniel Brito, the Ironhack Placements manager and one of the most genuine/well connected humans I have ever met.

I accepted the offer from Ironhack two days after the meeting, quit my job, and began my UX/UI journey for the next 3 months.

The friends I've made, students, mentors, and industry professionals, was something that I did not expect. THIS IS NOT ANTOTHER DESIGN MILL CHURNING OUT STUDENTS PEOPLE. This is a real community of designers, developers, and creative professionals coming together to help each other be the best they can be.

The instructors who taught the course varied in design expertise, but all truly cared about your sucesss. They provided revelant design skills, insights, and mentorship, allowing me to learn about things that have helped me succeed as a professional today. Now I do reccommend that you consider the amount of time you want to put in here. What you put in as far as questions and extra practice is all up to you and will benefit you if you allow it to. They will give you the water but it is your decision to drink, so to speak. The course is broken up into different parts of the design process, for different weeks, and this allowed us to really deep dive into the specific designs skills that we needed.

Professionally, the course also provided resume/portfolio advice, mock interviews, and branding guidance. They teach you skills as a designer but also prepare your brand to be competitive in this field. This is something that places Ironhack a notch ahead of other schools.

Upon hiring week, yes they have a hiring week, I interviewed with 12 potential companies, gainining 3 job offers and accepting one offer for a well-paid consulting gig. Now, like I mentioned previously, you have to listen to what Daniel Brito, the hiring manager, says to a tee, he is an industry expert and will give you the best advice if you listen. You also have to put in the time during/after class to sharpen you skills and listen to the design instructors, they will not give you the job you have to honestly work for it.

Overall the most important thing I learned from this course, besides the many design skills, was that you can accomplish anything if you truly put your mind to it. My class consisted of students from all types of backgrounds, biology, anthropology, I came from psychology and digital marketing. But we all gained enough valuable skills and contacts in the field to accomplish our goals, whatever that was to each individual.

238275,2017.0,True,Summer of Web Dev in Paris,"I started the Web Dev bootcamp having had some academic experience in programming a few years before (introductory computer science university courses).
My goal was to learn the professional basis of web development, in order to later be in a confident position to apply, work and gain experience in the field. Having finished this course about a month ago, I conclude that this mission has been achieved :)

After finishing the course, I was offered to stay on board as a teacher assistant in the next cohort, in addition to the more experienced teachers already on the team. I accepted this opportunity with pleasure, having done tutoring in the past, and as I found Ironhack to be a productive and fun environment.

A few good points about the course, from a mixed perspective of a former student and a current team member:

As a student, I found the Ironhack team to be personal, accessible and dedicated to its students. The general manager and all the other staff were always a room away, and ready to greet anyone with kindness and a positive change attitude.
 
Having researched the market a bit, and consulting friends who are experienced developers, the curriculum learned in the course seems to be extremely relevant to the current ecosystem. As a team member, I notice the effort we make to constantly adjust the course as needed. This is a regular mission, as technologies change, trends come and go and the market shifts.
 
However, beyond the specific technologies learned, the most important skill I gained during this bootcamp was the conceptual understanding of the process and architecture of a full-stack project. For instance, a strong focus was understanding what APIs are, how they are designed, and how they serve as a kind of language to interact with data. Understanding and practically implementing such modern web dev concepts are indispensible in becoming a developer yourself.
I now feel confident starting my career as a web developer, and so I can recommend this experience for whoever is in a similar situation.",9/26/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
238187,2017.0,True,FT Web Development Bootcamp,"Prior to attending Ironhack I worked as a teacher and coded whenever I was able to find the time. As I coded on my own, I would often find myself getting stuck, frustrated, and not knowing where to turn. After research and visiting several bootcamps in the Miami area, I decided to attend Ironhack for the full time web development course. One of the key factors in my decision was the desire to learn Javascript and the MEAN stack, since I knew they are popular and in-demand technologies of the web and Ironhack had recently re-vamped their curriculum to reflect that.

The staff at Ironhack is like a family; they do everything they can to make students feel a part of that family, as well as a part of the Miami tech scene. Marisa, Danny, and Alia are always checking in to make sure you feel supported and are adjusting well throughout the course. Nizar, the lead instructor, is awesome! Not only is he a smart, experienced teacher and a Javascript wizard, he’s also extremely helpful and humble. He is very patient and takes the time to break everything down so you truly understand the concepts, whether it is as a class, or one-on-one. He supports his students, giving them the confidence and tools to succeed in anyway he can. He gets to class early, stays late, and gives 110% every day. 

The TA’s at Ironhack, Kevin and Ariel, are former graduates of the program. They are very knowledgeable and help support the students since they have been through the bootcamp experience themselves. Instead of just telling you how to solve whatever you may be having difficulty with, they help guide you to the solution so that you can really think like a programmer. If you are really stuck, both Kevin and Ariel do a great job of reinforcing key concepts.

Daniel Brito, the placements manager is one of the most passionate people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. If you are seeking a job after graduation, Daniel is one of the most powerful weapons in your arsenal! He is a networking guru in the Miami tech scene and has the top players come in to speak to the class.  He constantly encourages you to have “no chill” and will work hard and fight for you so long as you put in the work.

The most important things I gained from attending Ironhack are learning programming and knowing where to turn when I got stuck. Ironhack taught me the foundations of web development and skills that I can transfer as I learn new programming languages and grow as a developer. I was able to get a full time job as a developer a little over a week after graduation, and I can truly say Ironhack has helped me change my life!

Now you might be reading this and asking yourself, ""so this sounds great, but what's the catch?"". There is no catch, but don't be fooled into thinking this course is easy. The amount of information you learn and the speed of the course is very intense. You have to put in a lot of time and effort into every aspect, both inside and outside of the classroom. There will be days where you're exhausted, you want to slam your head against a brick wall in frustration, and your code just won't work. But if you work hard, trust the process, and seek support, you will finish the course in disbelief with what you've accomplished in such a short time.",9/25/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
238073,2017.0,True,Full Time Web Development in Paris,"I took Ironhack's Full Time Web Development course in Paris over the summer 2017. It was the first batch for the Paris Ironhack campus. My motivation for taking this course was to build up the skills necessary to code the prototype of a project I had a mind. Having finished the course 3 weeks ago, I can definitely now say: mission accomplished!

I'm today fully able to build a full-stack web app on my own and I knew close to nothing about web development on day 1. Disclaimer: I had had some coding experience some 10 years ago in unviveristy but nothing related to web development. Bottom line: I fully recommend taking this course in Paris.

Here are a few highlights:

The team (teaching and non-teaching) is amazing! They are very attentive, thoughtful and friendly
The course material is very comprehensive, with a lot of opportunities for putting theory in practice. It is so well detailed that you could almost follow it on your own.
The student-teacher ratio was quite low for a coding bootcamp (maybe 5-6 to 1 on average)
The extra-curriculars were nice: talks, events, happy hours. The team has close access to the tech world in Paris and was able to bring in some interesting players.
The location is amazing, in the heart of Paris. The WeWork office where it was held is a really high end location - the rooftop view!!

It's hard to believe that a course can teach Full-Stack Web Development in 9 weeks, and get you ready for a job in the field. Before I get into my review, let me preface it with a little information about myself. Prior to Ironhack, I worked as a line-cook, with no college and almost no programming knowledge. A week and a half after Ironhack ended, I had two full-time job offers to become a Web Developer. Now, it's not a magic wand, that will automatically give you a job. You have to work for it, and you have to love what you do. It is an intense course.

The intensity of the course, did teach me one of the most important things, when becoming a developer, and that is how to learn. The tech industry is constantly changing, and since the course is very fast pace, you learn to learn, and that's what future employers want to see in junior developers. 

The instructor of the course is Nizar, and he knows his shit. Not only does he know what he's doing, he's extremely passionate about it and truly cares about his students. On multiple occasions he would stay well past 9, to make sure he could help everyone and ensure everyone is on the same page. Nizar is not only a great teacher, but a great mentor.The T.A.'s, Ariel and Kevin, were also always eager to help, and would always be there for guidance. Building upon that, the entire staff at Ironhack is truly wonderful. They care about your well-being and almost immediately become your family.

As mentioned earlier, the class is intense, it's definitely doable if you have the heart for it. My class size was about 20 students, but it was one of the larger cohorts. During the course, you truly become close with your fellow students as you're all going through the same experience. 

Brito, the job placement manager, is insane, and I mean that in the best way possible. In the last week, he will make sure you are absolutely prepared to get a job, whether it be making a resume, practicing interviews, and applying for jobs. He will do everything he can to make sure you get where you need to be, provided you put in the effort yourself. He's not there just to make sure you secure any job, just to boost some imaginary number. He will make sure that you get a job that is truly right for you.

Instead what I found is the most supportive network of individuals who truly understood the sacrifice I was making and gave their everything to make this a worthwhile experience.

Not everything was perfect, especifically for Part Timers the variation in instructors was not conducive to the most stramlined way of learning, but they adressed these issues personally with us, assuring we still got everything we needed and did not feel left behind.

I definitely recommend Ironhack for anyone trying to make a change in their lives.

237586,2017.0,True,I couldn't imagine someone can learn this much in just 9 weeks!,"I went to Ironhack because I had a background in Computer Science but had little to zero experience with Web Development. I like that they gave us a pre-work exercise couple months before the bootcamp started so that everybody starts more or less at the same level. The location, building and stuff are super nice! Everybody is very friendly and willing to help. Our instructor Nizar is very knowledgeable and is a true Javascript ninja that can answer pretty much any question you might have about coding. Nizar is also very dedicated and truly loves coding which makes him an excellent mentor. Kevin and Ariel as TAs were very helpful and would stay with students even after hours to help which is great!  Daniel Brito was very positive and  knowledgeable. He is a placements manager and will do his best to help you land a job in this field so be sure to listen to his advices and attend the social events (super important!). Alia Poonawala is super friendly and nice and I think Ironhack Miami is in good hands with her as a bootcamp director.
The reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars because of the curriculum/pace. In my opinion we were spending too much time on easy things especially in the first 1.5 weeks which has led to falling a bit behind on a schedule and having to skip some topics/exercises later in a course. I do recommend future students to try and complete those after hours as you will gain more experience and have better understanding of how things work.

237394,2017.0,True,5 stars,"What is taught at Ironhack is the MEAN stack, which is incredibly valuable to learn as is one of the most demanding technologies on the market. Also, team work, resilience to frustration and how to overcome it was definitely a strong take away from the course.

I got a front-end job a week after I finish the Bootcamp, and I can say that is thanks to Ironhack, I think that says all about career impact. The learning content and interview preparation are both invaluable for succeeding on technical interviews.

The instructors are all experienced developers with years in the industry, therefore they don’t only teach you the technologies but also give you good advice on how to succeed as a developer and what companies are looking for.

Ironhack’s staff is awesome, they are always there for you. They listen to your concerns and try to resolve any issues you might be having. They even schedule 1to1’s with students regularly to make sure you are happy with everything.

237319,2016.0,True,Much Love For Ironhack,"Ironhack really struck a great balance between theoretical foundations from which to continue learning and broadening your skill-set, and practical skills that can make you a productive member of a dev team straight out of the gates. Nizar was a great instructor. His passion for teaching programming and helping students understand complex issues in the most basic terms was very evident. Josh was a great compliment to Nizar as they were both consistent in what they would teach but often took different approaches and perspectives to problems. The staff in general was very friendly and accomodating. You could tell while being around them that they all truly beleived in the mission of Ironhack and they took their rolls seriously. The comradery that the students developed in the classroom was one of the most surprising parts of Ironhack for me. Week 0 you walk into a room full of strangers and by week 3 you feel like your amongst family. Unlike a traditional classroom in highschool or University, 100% of the students in the cohort take the course seriously and want to make the most out of their experience. That leads to a truly collaborative and learning focused environment the likes of which I had never experienced before. That classroom atmosphere really helped take the course to the next level. When you are learning from and teaching your peers, it really helps reinforce the concepts and skills you're  acquiring. Daniel Brito, the placements manager, is really the guy you want to be best friends with. He is 100% invested in placing you in the best career opportunity possible and he takes his job seriously. He helped me tremendously in landing my first job and even now I continue to maintain a great relationship with him. He has a plug into the entire tech sector in Miami and is one of the most valuable resources at your disposal as an Ironhacker. Overall, I think Ironhack did more for my career than my four year university ever did and I would recommend it to anyone willing to put in the time and effort required to develop a new skill and enter the most quickly growing career field in the world today and for the foreseeable future.",8/22/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

This program literally changed my life forever! I came with a background of computer science and studied outside of a traditional school, using free online tools such as codeacademy, treehouse, and tons of Youtube tutorials.  I decided to move down to Florida and really challenge myself to become a real developer.  The reason why I love Ironhack so much is that, they really start everyone at the same level, and break you down (mentally), so you can rebuild with the proper structure of becoming a web developer.  Their approach is that the only real thing stopping you from learning to code, is truly yourself.  The real battle is convincing yourself daily that you CAN DO THIS!!! dreams come true when you work HARD AS F!!!! lol.  

The teaching staff deserve so much praise!

Nizar was our main teacher for the entire 9 week program, and he is like a coding genius, who truly takes his sweet time with you on every single step of the coding theory and lessons.  He truly takes you from zero knowledge, to building mega website platforms.  Nizar is always helpful and kind to every student.  You don't feel rushed at all in his classroom.  Thank you Nizar!!!



To the Teaching Assistant - Ariel and Kevin,

This guys are extremely helpful when it was time to do pair programming exercises and solo coding challenges.  They're always walking around and lending you some advice and tips to solve your problems.  Basically helping you think like a problem solver so you can learn for yourself.  These guys are coding ninjas for sure!!



Last but definitely not least! The Master of guiding you into the world of developers and technology - Brito



Brito is the MAN you must listen to at every chance he opens his mouth! His insight on current or former technologies, interview strategies, design police (make sure your projects don't look like shit lol) and what you need to do, so you can get a awesome job at being a web developer is Golden!!  This man will help you only if you follow his advice and work hard during and after  the Ironhack program is over.  Brito is also one of the most kindest and generous man I've met thus far.  His support and guidance to help you land your first web developer role, is something to truly respect.  Thanks Bro!

237300,2017.0,True,UX/UI course,"I went through the application process at three UX boot camps simultaneously. Ironhack immediately stood out to me in terms of The attention I received as a prospective student. I also felt like they had a grasp on the fact that teaching UX was a whole different animal than teaching coding, whereas it seemed some other schools just added it to the curriculum with zero research or understanding.

I interviewed with Marisa, Alia and, on my request, was also able to speak with Brito, the career placements manager. Each of them was very real and open with me, answering all my questions. Actually taking it a step further, because Alia made sure I had contact information for any former students I wanted to speak with.

When I was accepted to the program, I received personal phone calls from both Alia and Marisa. I mention this because it was in stark contrast from what the other schools sent: a form email that referred to coding bootcamp and a GitHub invite. The care and concern was followed through from day one. Weekly surveys and one-on-one talks that the staff holds with each student allow any issues (from speed of the class to mental wellbeing) to be addressed. When you're working so many hours, it's sometimes just extremely comforting to be able to sound off!

The main staff at Ironhack is pretty amazing. Marisa made it clear that she was always available and legitimately cheered us all on throughout our weeks of hard work. The UX class has a lot of moving parts, with new professors every week, professional mentors coming and events outside of the program, and she managed it all with genuine enthusiasm. Pretty sure she could run a small country. Alia was a calming presence in the building. Even though a lot of her job happens behind the scenes, she knows and actively cares about every student that walks in the door.

I can honestly say that Brito has been one of the most supportive people in my life while I made this career move. He used his network to give a couple of my UX endeavors a lot of attention which is above and beyond any job description he has. He hustles hard for each and every student when in comes to career placement. I had 10 interviews the last day of Ironhack. That's insane. I ended up accepting another offer from a company I'd interviewed with the previous day (who had hired ironhack web dev students in the past through Brito's hiring fair) and I started work the following Monday. Even then, I heard that Brito had reached out to them to give me a solid recommendation.

And of course, my classmates were the most amazing humans. We helped each other to be better every day of class and continue to help each other as we enter the professional world. We could have seen each other as competition, since we'd be going for the same jobs, but we became a community instead.",8/21/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,,5.0,ironhack
237272,2017.0,True,Great summer learning experience,"I joined Ironhack due to my strong desire for self-directed learning, particularly programming.  I entered Ironhack with prior experience as a front-end developer at an agency and a few computer science classes at college.  I thought the course started off slowly and I had concerns about where I would be by the end of it.  By the end of the course, I was extremely satisfied.

Nizar was a phenomenal instructor and took plenty of time to make sure we understood didfficult concepts.  He's also a great, humorous guy we all got to know over the course of 9 weeks.  Nizar is better than most college computer science professors I have had.  

The Ironhack staff is welcoming and passionate about what they do everyday.  They realize the risk we are taking and support us wholeheartedly.  

Ironhack is also in a great location!  Building.co, the coworking space Ironhack uses, has a provides a kitchen, snacks, and coffee to Ironhack students.  The building is extremely well maintained, and the classroom lets in plenty of natural light, so you don't feel stuck in a building all day.  There is also a grerat outdoor rooftop to eat lunch, play games, and relax.

Brito is equally phenomenal as Nizar is as an instructor.  He loves what he gets to do, and it shows.  Although I was not searching for a job afterwards, Brito is willing to help connect you to the right people in the tech community.  His network is ENDLESS.  Listen to this guy - he knows his stuff.

Ironhack has given me the confidence to continue to learn as a developer, and pursue my own ventures.  The connections you gain here are truly valuable.

237200,2017.0,True,Full Stack Web Development course (fulltime),"3 months at Ironhack is all it takes to change not only your career, but also your life. At first I was a little hesitant to start a bootcamp as I came from a Tourism/Hospitality background and had no Tech experience what so ever except from learning HTML and CSS (and a little bit of Wordpress) on my own. However, at some point I found myself stuck in my own learning process and decided to look into Ironhack. I was able to come by that same day for an introduction and that is where it all started. Now a couple months later, I am officially a Front End Web Developer at a modern and thriving company! For everyone thinking about doing this bootcamp, I have a few pieces of advise for you: First of all DO IT! It will be the best decision in your life! Also, put in the work. I am not going to lie that it is tough! It took me blood, sweat and tears (literally) to keep up! Learning to become a full stack web developer in (not even) 3 months, which most people not even learn in a year.... You do the math!

I want to give a special shoutout to Nizar, our Lead Instructor for the course. This guy offered us twice to come in on a Sunday to bring us up to speed. (we were a little behind on our work, because of national holidays). This to me screams passion for your work. Also all the extra work that he put in like staying late to debug our errors and make sure our application is back up because it crashed the day before presentation day.... it is very much appreciated!

Also the TA's Ariel and Kevin were great for extra support and guidance. They help you out wherever they can but more important, they also give you the space to find your own solutions for ""learning how to learn"" purposes.

The classroom environment was the best I have ever experienced. It is beautiful to see how many different nationalities and backgrounds get along so well and help eachother out where possible. Also the yoga sessions on the rooftop and lunches at Burgers & Beer really set the tone for a great time among the students (and teachers :) )

Last but not least a big thank you to Brito, who is the placements Manager. He helped us getting ready for the job hunt. From giving pointers to set up your LinkedIn page and resume, to do's and don'ts for your job interview and to arranging some great guest speakers that would tell us about their experience and that would answer all questions we would have. This all lead to me getting hired as a Front End Web Developer even a week before graduating. Thank you again!

The fact that in class they encourage us to find solutions on our own, gave us the power to be self-sufficient.  Project weeks are the best. Those are the moments when everything comes together, and you feel encourage to work hard and keep at it. 

Nizar, our instructor was Amazing and his classes were fun! His patience and love for teaching is self evident. Also his vast knowledge is admirable. 

Our T.A’s Kevin and Ariel they were both incredible. Although Kevin was a bit more approachable, Ariel dominates the subject incredibly well. 

Ironhack’s staff are all aces in my book. They are friendly, genuine, passionate and fresh. 

The classroom at Building.co was a key element for my success. The open areas, amenities and activities were fundamental to keep me focused and energized... and the coffee, specially the coffee! 

Brito, the Placement Manager, is without doubt the warrior that fight next to you.  His advise, wisdom, and passion made me feel confident about my potential and value. Since the day I had my admission interview, I knew I could count on him. Everything he promised he delivered, and more.

While I will always be proud of the achievement’s I made on my own, going to Ironhack has completely changed my career, the way I learn, and my understanding of programming. In retrospect I now know I knew just the surface of most elements of the development life cycle, and core logic of coding. Ironhack took me deep into the logic and overall understanding of software and because of that I can now proudly say I wake up each day feeling and knowing I am a full stack developer. 

The staff at Ironhack went above and beyond to ensure everyone’s success. Nizar is one of the best instructors I have ever had, and I don’t say that lightly! His patience and dedication are inspiring. I hope he teaches forever because I don’t think there are many out there with the technical talent and ability to teach on this level. 

Our TA’s Ariel and Kevin bring energy and creative insight to the course that keeps you going even when you are sure you can’t finish, or understand a concept.  The will work with you through the challenges and celebrate your achievements every step of the way.

Daniel Brito is the career wizard at Ironhack. His dedication to your success is genuine and he stays with you even after the course making sure you stay on the path to success. He taught us so much about building our brand and awareness into the world of software careers. This comes from years of experience and insightful knowledge that is priceless. 

I will end this by saying a few things. One I would go back and do it again in a heartbeat. Even the hard times, the late nights, every moment of it brought me where I am today. Two I am happy to say that after Ironhack not only do I have a job as a full stack developer right out of school but also am working with a software company to bring my hackshow project to market, which would have never been possible without the knowledge and drive I gained at Ironhack.

So, why did I decide to join this bootcamp? Because making the transition from being someone who codes for fun to someone who gets paid to code is tough without the connections, it's tough without asking peers what has been like for them. Ironhack provided me with a supportive community full of people who inspired me and this is why I will forever love this place.

Nizar, our main instructor, is undeniably great at what he does. He truly wants you to get it, he is patient and dedicated. This is a genius developer who could be working anywhere he would like and instead chose to help a group of people achieve their goal of being real world developers.

I'm also incredibly thankful to Alia, who's now the Director of this campus. She was the one who introduced me to Ironhack and I didn't even consider any other bootcamp the moment I talked to her. This place is full of passionate people who truly want to help you. Another one of them is Daniel Brito, our Placements Manager, this guy couldn't fit his personality is a room if he wanted to. He will go to any extent to help you understand what you need to do to get a job as a developer. We had several great guest speakers, all scheduled by him. Brito will remind you throughout the course that getting that job, which is the ultimately goal for a lot of us, is not only about being good at coding but about putting in the effort for all these other steps-- and he will help you set that up. 

My classmates were another valuable part of the experience. We all got along and supported each other throughout the course. It was refreshing and inspiring to be around this great group of people from so many different backgrounds and ages, I learned a great deal from them. 

I was really proactive on that LinkedIn and was able to land a job before finishing the bootcamp.

I had some previous front end knowledge but not back end. I studied graphic design (nothing related to IT) and after the 3 first weeks I became able to build simple web apps with Ruby on Rails! Seems impossible but it’s completely affordable.

We spent 8 hours per day in a standard class with amazing teachers that drive you from the more basic things to more expertise via good coding examples and exercices.

Then, after 8 hours with guided lessons you were able to continue working on extra exercices that cover through real project examples what has been done during the standard lesson.

Mi point of view is that if you would like to achieve a good level there is needed to at least dedicate between 2-5 extra hours per day to consolidate all material. Don't worry about don't see your common friends, in Ironhack you will have a family!

I would like to said also that before finish the bootcamp I got a job in a top international IT company located in Barcelona (I had a lot of interviews, because Ironhack also pushes you to get a job thouroug all the events and contacts that they have, and I succeed in some of them. I got 3 job offers). I jump from a creative job to a developer one in just 4 months, everything is possible if you are brave enough!

Ha sido una de las mejores experiencias de formación que he tenido. Pasas por momentos de estrés, momentos en que piensas que no te quedas con nada, pero ver como a medida que va avanzando el curso y realmente te das cuenta de que te van saliendo las cosas y vas acordándote de todo lo que has ido haciendo es muy gratificante, en parte gracias tanto a los compañeros como a los profesores, que siempre están para ayudarte.
Yo diría que lo más importante que he aprendido es aprender a aprender, este curso te enseña a programar y a saber cómo hacer aquello que todavía no sabes hacer.

236853,2017.0,True,Fantastic Full Time Full Stack Course,"Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge the amazing team there, because they are an integral part of what makes this bootcamp so amazing:

Nizar (instructor) - Nizar's expertise is invaluable. He also clearly has a passion for teaching and empowering others to learn. Its clear he really cares about his students and whether or not they are keeping up. He had stayed late many times because someone needed his help. By the end of the course my class bought him a golden pizza trophy because we were so grateful to have him. 

Daniel Brito (placements manager) - If you do your part, you can trust that Brito will do his to get you a job. He is very much involved throughout the entire course, whether its setting up amazing speakers to coming in, helping you write your resume, or teaching you everything there is to know about being a good job candidate. He used to be a SR IT recruiter and has even gone through a web dev bootcamp himself so he has a wealth of knowledge and most importantly- contacts for networking.

Ariel Quinones (co-founder) - Really great guy, down to earth and is SO passionate about what he does. You'll see him around often and chat with him and he may even casually join you for lunch.

Other shoutouts:

Alia (general manager) is a joy to work with, she makes you feel like you can go to her for anything. You can tell she works her butt off to keep everything running smoothly and still always manages to have a smile on her face.

Ariel (assistant instructor) is super bright and really great at explaining difficult concepts and breaking them down.

My entire cohort- Awesome group to work with. Everyone was super friendly, non-judgmental, and always willing to work together and help each other out. I am so thankful that the people at Ironhack purposefully select people that they think can ""play well with others"". I made really great friends during my time there. 

Some other points I'd like to make:

- the Ironhack team does a really good job at asking you throughout the course what you think can be improved. They are also very in-tune with how you're feeling about your performance whether or not you need extra help or accomodations.
- The building where the course takes place is SUPER cool. There's a nice grassy rooftop to relax outside when you've been staring at a computer for hours. There's also a free keg and delicious snacks in the kitchen. Its also walking distance from the metro. Great spot.
- **You do NOT have to be an expert in JS to take this course, but you MUST have a firm grasp on it. The course moves very very quickly and you can't be spending time re-hashing JS. The entire course basically builds upon JS so make sure you can code it comfortably.**
- You're going to have to work on the weekends, otherwise you'll forget.
- Try being a week ahead on assignments and doing them on your own. That way when it comes time to go over it in class you've already digested it at least once and you're prepared to ask meaningful questions.
- The journey doesn't end after Ironhack, you'll have to work even harder to retain everything you've learned, apply it, and build on top of that knowledge. This bootcamp isn't a shortcut to a career, its a stepping stone.

Bottom line? Great people, great course. If you're committed to this craft and you have a passion for it, go for it.

I always say that it was like opening the door to a wonderful unknown world full of technological mysteries and magic. Yes, I wanted to be a magician, there was still a lot to learn but the door had been opened.

After the bootcamp, I was lucky enough to be offered a variety of very interesting jobs, partially because of my previous experience as a designer but mainly because I COULD NOW CODE. Many people still have no idea how different the world can be when you can code. So off I went, worked in three different startups managing projects, changing processes and contributing in the creation of amazingly innovative digital products.

During my MSc in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, I realized how important is to have at least some basic knowledge on programming. For that reason, I decided to join Ironhack last summer for the two months’ intensive bootcamp. 

I am very happy with the decision I made. In two months, I was able to learn in a structured way all the basic concepts and gain a solid base that allows me right now to keep learning, on my own, based on my needs. 

In my opinion, all the theoretical knowledge is important, but the only way to improve is to practice, to make mistakes and to learn from those mistakes.

236692,2016.0,True,Learn by doing.,"I had just presented my final career project and finished the Graphic Design Degree. I was
aware of the fact that with this professional profile I’d find so many amateurs and intrusiveness. I
had to specialize if I wanted to position, differentiate and define myself. And I wanted digital and
technology fields to be my professional playing field from then on.

I got my eyes on Ironhack for a year. Perhaps the first thing that attracted me from it was the
naming. “That must be a place where pro people come from”, I thought, and I wanted to become
one of them. As an intensive bootcamp, time saving was another important reason to take into
account, and so it was the fact that it didn’t follow the traditional educational model, tied to
stupid numerical qualifications. I was looking for applied theory. Utility. The “learn by doing”.
Finally, I took a step forward and moved to Madrid.

I would highlight people as the best part of the experience, both the Ironhack team, teachers (industry professionals) and class mates. The opportunity of being able to meet minds that are
worried about the same things as you, with ambitions and goals, and so much desire and
support. People who make you discover a world, and share and fuel your curiosity. Many “I can’t
with my life” followed by “God, this is what I love”, and continue progressing.

Today, I am part of the first UX / UI Ironhack MAD bootcamp promotion, and a new professional
competence with graphic design skills expanded with product design, interface and user
experience, among other things (such as 3D, audiovisual, music, photography and some front-
end). Notions that are extended every day by the self-taught work as well as the daily work as Design Director at Finect, a smart-data company in the Fintech sector whose goal is to bring
finances closer to the people.

Undoubtedly, Ironhack has been an open door. Now the key is to seek how to take advantage
of all the opportunities that appear. And the more you move, the more they appear. So don’t
stop moving and following the path of your concerns.

For any query, you can find me in Medium, Dribble and Twitter.

Kind regards, and continue improving.

236752,2016.0,True,Great trampoline for your professional career,"Even though I have a business background, I have always been interested and attracted to learn how to code. During my MSc in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, I realized how important is to have at least some basic knowledge on programming. For that reason, I decided to join Ironhack last summer for the two months’ intensive bootcamp. 

I am very happy with the decision I made. In two months, I was able to learn in a structured way all the basic concepts and gain a solid base that allows me right now to keep learning, on my own, based on my needs. 

In my opinion, all the theoretical knowledge is important, but the only way to improve is to practice, to make mistakes and to learn from those mistakes.

236576,2016.0,True,You Get What You Give,"If you go into Ironhack with the mindset that this course is one of many steps you must take before you become an amazing developer, you will succeed. Put in the hours during coding camp. Put in the effort during your job search. And most importantly put in the hours to continue your programming development after the course. 

If you think ANY codecamp can suddenly make you worthy of applying to Facebook etc as a developer at 200k, you probably need a reality check. Perhaps you could sell yourself yourself as a project manager who can do business and code after bootcamp, but to become a developer at that level, you will have to devote at least a year of self learning in which you work on some pretty kick ass projects to get you remotely close to that level. Have realistic expectations and dedication and you will be more than fine. 

I would recommend Ironhack to anyone who has a limited programing background and wants a truly immersive, yet fun experience. I made several meaningful friendships during my time at Ironhack. As for the instructors, Josh and Nizar were more than willing to spend extra time to develop those who wanted more than a surface understanding of the material. The job that I took after Ironhack happened to be a direct placement of Danny Brito. My first 3 months as a software engineer were intense as coding school gave me the foundation but it was my turn to quickly build on that foundation to perform on the level I desired.

Para mi ha sido un reto, ya que muchos compañeros tenían experiencia en este sector, por lo que el esfuerzo ha sido máximo, en algunas ocasiones ha sido desesperante pero cuando unes todas las piezas del puzzle sientes una gran satisfacción.

Es difícil para los que nos iniciamos en esto, no imposible, para mi ha sido un reto muy positivo y recomendable.

It's nice to say the friendships formed with the teachers and alumni still continue to be a part of my life today. To have that support and ongoing relationship is key to our development as people and designers alike.

*WARNING: This course is not for the faint hearted or procrastinators haha.  After all it is a Bootcamp.  You must be willing to put in 60-80hrs a week if you want to really benefit from it.  Just like learning a new language doesn't suffice in just taking classes but living out the culture in the native country, so one must really interiorize  the UX / UI methods & practices (24/7).

236346,2017.0,True,Everything I expected,"Before Ironhack I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering @ Florida International University. I worked on embedded systems and mobile device Operating Systems at BlackBerry for 2 years. After leaving BlackBerry, I wanted to get into Web Development. I'd never worked on web projects, but had always been interested. After not having any luck finding work, I decided to enroll in Ironhackers web development course in Madrid (I'm from Miami).

Ironhack and it's bootcamp were everything I expected! It was intense - 10+ hours a day coding. I had the opportunity to learn and work with really cool people who I continue to keep in contact with even though they're on the other side of the world!

I learned how to build a web app from the ground up. Among various frameworks, we focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - the essentials of web development. The course gave me the opportunity to work on 3 different projects which I was able to put on my resume to show what I've actually done! I can't stress enough how important this is when it comes time for job interviews - more so than experience.

I now work as a JavaScript Engineer at GumGum, a computer vision and advertising tech startup headquartered in Santa Monica, California. I can honestly say, I would never be where I am if it weren't for my experiences at Ironhack.

236342,2016.0,True,My Ironhack Experience,"I completed my Ironhack bootcamp in between my Sophomore and Junior year of college. I had been studying Computer Science at shool and had taken a few programming course before starting. I did know how to code, but I had difficulties when entering higher level courses since I thought my foundation was not strong and that I lacked having a full understanding of basic programming fundamentals. I also had no idea what type of programming field I wanted to enter since I was only 20, so applying for an internship was difficult. I really wanted to take my 3 month summer vacation and learn a lot, which was when I turned to Ironhack. 

Ironhack was the best decision I made as a programmer. I still am amazed at how much I learned in 10 weeks. The circulum of the Web Development bootcamp was outstanding. I was learning languages I wasn't getting the opportunity to work on at school, and it focused on both Back-end and Front-end development, so I got to see what type might interest me to later on pursue as a career. The experience was long and tedidous, but I would recommend it to ANYONE seriously interested in programming. Although I had expierence coding beforehand, I ALWAYS felt a challange at Irohack and was constantly learning. I cannot say enough amazing things about the lead instructor, Nizar, and the T.A., Nick. They dedicate so much time and effort to make sure everyone in the class is on the same page. Both would answer any questions I had. I was finally having those ""aha"" moments where concepts finally clicked that I was missing at school! 

Although it was definitely rigorous, the Ironhack environment was always so much fun. There was never a day that I wasn't excited to come into class. I loved the partnered exercises. I really felt that they were beneficial since you will always be working with people in a work environment. The assignments you work on are about interesting topics such as creating a movie triva game or using the Spotify API. For the final project, the topic is up to you, and working on it was definitely my favorite part of the bootcamp. Not only did I really see the progress I made, I got to work on an idea that I was passionate about and turn it into a fully functional website. 

When I returned to school in the fall, I felt so much more confident going into my classes and interviews. I now have a fully active GitHub that showcases all my hard work throughout the course, and I still use it today.",6/3/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
236336,2016.0,True,My personal experience at IronHack,"Before IronHack I was a sound engineer working in a cinema as a technician. When the crisis hit, I traveled to London to work and attend a Top Up Degree in sound technics. A lecturer introduced me to programming, and it was love at first sight. I decided at that moment to become an app developer, so I returned to Spain to make it happen.

Ironhack was such an amazing experience. In my opinion, when you learn how to write code you are learning valuable skills to develop software, but you are also unlocking your brain's potential and developing ways of thinking alternatively. It's not easy to learn to program, but it's 100% worth it. IronHack is the key to unlocking your full potential in no time. In record time their program can boost your career, and I enjoyed it a lot.

I think that the most valuable knowledge that you learn with Ironhack is how the software industry works.They taught me how to break an idea into smaller pieces and translate it into code. It's not only learning a programming language, it's improving analytical skills that help me to understand almost any language, framework, or tool in a brief period of time.

The best part was having the chance to share a couple of months with people who love coding.

Just one week after Ironhack, I found my first job as a developer. Now I work in the banking industry handling massive payments as a full-stack developer with Java. In addition, I use other technologies such as Scala, Vanilla JS/JS Frameworks, PL/SQL, and Bash scripting on a daily basis.
Learning how to write code has changed my life. It opened the doors for a brighter future in only a year and made me feel more confident.

Fue mucho mejor de lo que me esperaba. No sabía muy bien lo que iba a encontrar allí y resultó una experiencia genial. Amigos, buenos profesores, trabajo duro, mucha ayuda por parte del equipo… Es muy completa porque no sólo vas a clase y ya está, sino que hay muchas más actividades como conferencias, comidas, trabajos en grupo o cervezas.

Éramos un grupo muy heterogéneo (con background muy distintos y edades variadas) y cada uno tenía cosas chulísimas para aportar a los demás, nos complementamos muy bien y los trabajos en grupo salían siempre enriquecidos por ello.
Mi caso es algo distinto a los demás porque tenía que acabar el proyecto fin de carrera al terminar el Boot Camp y no me podía incorporar al mundo laboral directamente.

236324,2017.0,True,Expectations fulfilled,"My background:  I finished my computer Science Engineering 10 years ago, since then I have been working mainly as systems Engineer , having very little programming involved at my work.

 I´m a very practical person whow has always pretty clear my objectives , so the decision to go to Ironhack was taken after months of  careful research pursuing the best option and valuing what steps should I make on my professional career.

Just before the bootcamp  I was working as an IBM Presales Engineer in a mixed role : half technician / half commertial). The technical part did not involve programming .

  IronHack has fullfilled the expectatives i had for the bootcamp: First getting used to programming and  the new technologies  used by the market at this day, Second  find a Job right after  the bootcamp so I could start as soon as possible to program and keep growing as a programmer, I acomplished both at the end of the bootcamp ( on the job part  I had 2 offers just by one week of interviews).

I would recommend the experience , even though a minimal comprension of programming is required , any person with passion and hardwork can pass it through. I enjoyed mostly every day with new practices and new things to learn and hard challenges to confront everyday , lets be clear about this ,Ironhack its not easy and is very intentse, but  the benefits adquired through strugling and frustration are more rewarding with the system it has ( having to do a weekly proyect on week 3 already).

I´m currently working as a FrontEnd Developer developing an application running in Angular ( one of the technologies covered by the bootcamp)  at a digital marketing company that develops its own solutions. Having done several proyects at IH made my integration at the developer´s team very fast and within the first month I was on the same programming path as my companions.

About the staff and professionals that works at IronHack i´ve got no complains as they were trustworthy and had the knowledge I seeked to fulfill my goals. I also had luck having great fellow students that were encouraging each other whenever one got stuck over difficult issues . 

If you are researching IH I think the best way is to ask one of the ex-alumni that are over internet, linkedin or even in person at the events.

I learned to learn from mistakes and that to be an expert in something you need to practice and never give up. The best aspect of Ironhack was the environment in which you learn to code. The teachers, assistants, managers, and collegues are always so open to help and motivate to give the best effort always.

236278,2017.0,True,Happy about the UX/UI Bootcamp,"I did the UX/UI bootcamp at Ironhack and I just want to express some words about two of the most-intensive months in my life. It was something I really enjoyed and I would recommend it 100%. 

Few months ago I was lucky to talk with some of the last edition's students before I started my bootcamp and they told me: “Say goodbye to your friends and family because you are not going to see them in two months” and also “The more you get involved, the more benefit you will get”. Well... after the bootcamp I can say that it was totally true and that it exceeded my expectations, mainly because I could not believe it would be so easy to find a job. It definitely was.

It can be said that Ironhack is not just a matter of studying but also working hard and being involved in a ""Learn by Doing Community"". You work hard developing projects during the bootcamp, alone and with your mates. It is not studying theory but learning from the best professionals sharing their experience and from every mistake you do.

The ""Community issue"" is one of my favourites: when you learn and work with other people, as you help each other, you see everyone gets to different solutions starting at the same point. You realise that the team grows ten times faster than you would learn online or in other courses. And also we got involved in the professional community: that helped us a lot to find jobs after the Bootcamp. Everybody says ""College do not prepare people to work and you need to start in a job to really learn"". Well, we had that first working experience really fast at Ironhack (that is the reason it is so tough) so I started working with more confidence about what I was able to do.",5/30/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

236269,2015.0,True,From Kitchen Worker to Web Developer,"Disclaimer: I currently work for Ironhack

Why & How

Before Ironhack I was a kitchen worker, albeit not by choice. I had always been a gamer, tinkerer, and someone that could generally figure out electronics, but I found myself working a job I didn't really like, for pay that I knew was below me (sorry kitchen workers, it's below everyone).

I began my journey by attending a local Pittsburgh school (where I resided previously), studying software development. After taking a host of prerequisite courses, I finally had one online coding class scheduled in after a semester full of speech, philosophy, and biology. Much to my dismay, it was outdated; generally not that well put together; and taught me no valuable skills related to the field, which I can now objectively say as I'm in it.

Fortunately, somewhere in that first semester of college, a family member told me about a radio show on NPR that mentioned coding bootcamps. As that second miserable semester and job-related stress began to grow, the idea seemed more and more like it should be a reality. I began looking into schools with none other than course report.

At the time in Miami, Ironhack was brand new, although they were an established brand in Madrid & Barcelona. There was another coding school in the area, but they lacked the international credentials and reviews from previous students that would allow me to feel comfortable in putting down a significant amount of money, move to another state, and restart my life. After the course, and being a part of the Miami tech scene, I can say that this was great intuition and am very happy with that decision.

The People

Ironhack from the start was unbelievably helpful. At the time, the team was very small, but I always had the opportunity to be in direct contact with the co-founder; Ariel.

Ariel is an impressive co-founder and found a way to avoid the bad bits of Miami tech. At Ironhack, the people you will graduate with, be mentored by, and listen to as guest speakers are the top of the top.  This is also reflected in the people he hires.

Nizar, the head instructor, is a legend amongst Ironhackers and this isn't without warrant. He's an incredibly patient, talented teacher and developer. This is an incredibly rare combination. Often times in traditional schools (in my experience) you will encounter good coders who just don't have the ability to teach. This is why so many people think they can't code coming out of school. From interview to graduation, and beyond, Nizar is a rockstar.

The Course 

The interview process was a bit nerve wracking, as most interviews are; but if you follow directions, put in the work to study, and really want to change your life you will succeed. You will be expected to learn a few coding topics relatively quickly, and then be tested on it.

The course itself is more than likely unlike most academic experiences you've taken part in.

Often times in school, you'll be introduced to facts and then be expected to memorize them. Once these facts are memorized, you'll spit them back out onto a quiz, and some person in the ivory tower gives you a piece of paper that says you're smart. 

This mentality is busted in development, and Ironhack's curriculum reflects that. You will be introduced to topics, given examples and the opportunity to ask questions, and then it's off to the races. You will build something. This is the X factor that online platforms such as codeacademy, treehouse, and others are missing. This is what propels you to be a quality developer. Building Things.

There are no easy A's. You're judged on what you build. That is life as a developer.

My Advice

If you aren't happy with the way things are, change it. Do your due dilligence, sift through reviews, and call each bootcamp. I did this, I can say at this point based off of my skills and quality of life that I made the correct decision.",5/29/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
236254,2016.0,True,Rare opportunity to learn at a fast pace,"The Ironhack Webdev bootcamp is a game changer. The course focuses on a range of tools that set you up to jump into the developing world and work on real projects as a Junior Web developer. I was able to build iterations of personal projects and intern at a health tech company a few months after the course.  The program goes by quickly, you'll find yourself working in groups each day, culminating in a final project. By the end you will feel competent in RoR/ JS/ Html-CSS and ready for interviews. The head instructor Nizar and Nick the TA will work with you until you get the concepts and can fly solo, so you will leave the course feeling like you have gained tangible skills.

236253,2017.0,True,"Don't come without an objetive, you may achieve it!","WHY I DID IT
I chose Ironhack Bootcamp because it motivated me the fact of being part of a community rather than just signing up for a course for going to class and then go home. Of course, once you'r there it's up to you to be part of it or just attend to classes. 

HOW IT HELPED 
A bootcamp helps you to put your first step in to the world you are seeking to enter into, in this case the design world, which in Barcelona is very closed. While after university there is a huge gap between where you are and where you want to go, after Ironhack you actually have already contacts in where you want to go. In the bootcamp there will be events, people coming, lectures from interesting companies, but it will be up to you to network with them, nothing will come by itself. 

For example, after the hiring days 6 companies reached me and two weeks after I have offers for working for two of them. But it’s very up to you to have the initiative and search for the opportunities and also to decide which is a fair job deal. One month after I was hired in a big company with excellent wages and conditions, but still I feel it's rare. 

WHAT I LIKED
I went almost from zero in design. I had audiovisual background and it helped to improve some skills I  already had. But, I did build mostly everything from scratch. And now I feel like I increased 100% my skills. 
Immersive atmosphere it's all about design for 10 weeks. You will find yourself reading design articles while having breakfast and going to bed with design documentaries. 
""Team feeling"". You spent a lot of time with the same persons every day. You better deal with it, make the most for getting along with them and encourage them to make things together. You will end the bootcamp with a groups of friends extremely motivate with design. 

WHAT I MISSED
Going deeper in some parts of the curricula. 
More connection with lecturer's job during their classes. 
You are very free to do the tasks as good as you want. I missed more guidance when you feel demotivated in other to get better results for the portfolio. Not just getting task done because there are a deadlines.",5/28/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,2.7,[],3.0,2.0,3.0,ironhack

I had read great reviews about it online and they touted an excellenct job placement record. i find it's not very good to take information like that for granted, and so i enrolled with a healthy amount of skeptisism.

The course was fast paced, but not so much that it felt overwhelming. The way the course is structured encourages teamwork among the class, and fosters a sense of ""we're all in this together"" that adds to the learning experience immensly. I met some fantastic people in the course, some of whom i remain in business with today. Everyone has their stengths and weaknesses.

The facility is really great. It's wondeful to be a part of Building Co. You get to meet other people in the tech scene and really feel like a community. Plus the roof is a great place to bond with your team while playing cornhole.

I must admit I'm a little jealous that I missed out on the new MEAN stack curriculum, but Ruby On Rails has proved helpful in my current job. As far as career assistance goes, I didn't get a job offer (or at least one that I wanted to accept) as soon as I would have liked, but I did eventually accept a job that I was excited about and I do think that Ironhack helped me make the connection.

I learned how to create a project from the very beginning to the end, always thinking about the user it is aimed for. I learned to use new tools and got the needed knowledge for understanding UX/UI design and what goes beyond from it. The course requires a big effort, it can be a little intense, but the philosophy of ""learning by doing"" made it not boring at all.

236219,2017.0,True,"A two months experience, a new full world to know","My name is Guillermo, but from an early age everyone knows me as Simon, my surname. Before entering ironhack I studied the degree of multimedia and graphic design, which I believed would open many doors to the professional world, but it was not so. From that moment I started to look at sites and courses to specialize in something, then I discovered ironhack since they offered a scholarship to make the UX / UI design bootcamp. The fact is that I tried my luck with the Madrid scholarship (there was another for Barcelona) and I won it. At that time I did not know very well what that was, so I researched a bit on the internet, went to a couple of talks and finally I decided to take the course.

The bootcamp in ironhack lasted two months, two of the most intense and stressful months of my life, but I say this with a smile from ear to ear since I do not regret anything. I take a lot of ironhack, all that we learned, the professionals who have shared with us their wisdom, experience and tricks, the colleagues and friends that I have met and with whom I have shared this trip ...

What I most liked and impressed me at the same time is all I have learned. In two months of bootcamp I have learned more than in 4 years of design career. If it is true that I have known new fields of study, because the UX was new to me, but right now I do not say that I am a graphic designer, I say that I am a UX / UI designer.

When I finished the bootcamp I saw how fleeting it had been, I remembered every afternoon that I stayed in ironhack until 10 pm when there was nobody in the facility, all the exercises and the walls full of post-its, the classes teached by people that was was their daily bread form them... and I only had to look forward and trust that I would find work. And so, just one week after finishing the bootcamp already had two job offers.

Since I finished the bootcamp I have not stopped researching, reading, searching, experimenting... they have awakened on me a curiosity for all this world that does not stop growing. And I know that I have a family in Ironhack.

Obviously some days it was really frustrating, because you can´t overcome an issue, but that´s part of the course, you need to learn to surpass the frustation. Without notice, I learned a huge amount of things, and after some weeks I felt ready to confront any challenge. 

On my personal experience, I learned a lot about coding environment . I came from a super different background, where almost everything has really similar ways of doing things. What is awesome about coding, is that you have thousands of ways to do things. So I can say, I learned to learn, and take my scares off about coding. The best? The everyday environment at school, it was awesome, the classmate and the staff was incredible and make a huge working making the 12hs a day really bearable. 

I really enjoy the hiring week, unlike any other I have had, I think the key about this one is that you got 10 minutes with every employeer to show your projects and talk about your working expectations. This is awesome, because first of all, it force you to talk to every company, and in the same way, force the employeers to pay atention to you in those 10 minutes.",5/24/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

As the weeks go by, you form a family with your peers and instructors that help you grit it out and come out a well developed web developer. 

At the end of the day, this is a huge jump to make, especially if you're coming from another state like I did.

236183,2016.0,True,Best Decision in my Life,"When I decided to join Ironhack's Bootcamp of Full Stack Web Development, I was scared: my age, even my gender, which already was being an obstacle in several professions. 

I studied in a Spanish University, which I remember as the worst waste of time in my whole life. Ironhack changed it, for good. I still remember an inspiring speech of Alvaro Cotello, Campus Manager in Ironhack Madrid: ""Destroy University"". And that phrase took my hand to the next level. Because that's what I think as a key for changing things and evolve.

 I have to say that they won't give a magic key to you: you will have to give the best of yourself, you will have to work hard. Remember: you will forget your family, friends, even sleeping properly, for several weeks, and you will always know everything's worth it. Definitely, you will learn to learn, you will learn to think in another way, as a real programmer.

After the bootcamp I spent some time studying more, working in a project by my own and suffering imposter syndrome. 

However, I repeat: it's in your hand. And I have to say that actually I'm working in the company of my dreams.

236176,2016.0,True,I signed up for Ironhack and you wont believe what happened next.,"DISCALIMER: STUDIED AT IRONHACK OVER A YEAR AGO AND HAVE A NON PROGRAMMING ROLE

When I signed up for Ironhack I was extremely excited to begin my career as a Web Developer and engage in the startup and tech world in Miami! I have to say, Ironhack exceeded my expectations.
When I had my first interview with Alia is when I fell in love with the Ironhack. I felt like she truly cared about my well-being. She wanted to know my dreams and aspirations and what I wanted to get out of this program and most importantly she was honest. Alia was upfront about what Ironhack could provide and if it was a worthwhile investment for me. After our discussion, I talked with my family and we all agreed that Ironhack provided the best opportunity to my grow and achieve my aspirations.
When I started the class, I was a bit nervous. Others seemed to be far ahead of me because of prior coding experience. To be frank, I was intimidated, I wanted to quit and didn't think I could ever catch up. After the first few days, Ironhacks true strengths started to reveal itself. Nizar, my instructor, and Josh, the teaching assistant, were extremely helpful. To be clear, they helped me think through a lot of the problems or guided me to resources. I appreciate this a lot because it developed my critical thinking skills and also pushed me to become a better programmer. Josh and Nizar were able to do this because of the intimate class size, and I felt they were truly passionate in myself and other classmates.
I also felt that the entire staff at Ironhack was unbelievable and open to having discussions with me. Ariel, one of the co-founders, was always at the campus and made it his goal to know all the students. He was always available to talk and address any concerns I had, or drink a few beers with me and the other students after a long week.
At the end of the course Ironhack did a great job of prepping us for work. While I did not end up taking a developer job, Ironhack set me up for success in two ways. The first, Ironhack taught me how to learn. There was no answer in the back of the book, there were resources like stack overflow that I had to use to figure out my bugs. I had to be resourceful, and truly think through problems to see if they made sense, this was a skill that Ironhack helped develop. Secondly, while I did not take a coding job, Ironhacks location in a co-working space worked great for me. I was offered an unbelievable opportunity by a tech company that worked out the same space two weeks before the completion of the program. I would have not had that opportunity come to me otherwise.
Ironhack was amazing, and an extremely worthwhile investment for me. While I don’t program now, I work with many developers who are helping build our product and it has made the conversations easier and the process 50x smoother. If you are interested in coding and are willing to do the work and challenge yourself, then sign up for a coding boot camp. If you really want to make a difference in your life, then sign up for Ironhack.

PS
I recently went to Ironhack site to check it out for old times’ sake and I saw they updated the course to more JavaScript and less ruby and they also added a UX/UI course. I think this is great because they are never settling on just one thing and want to provide as many unbelievable opportunities for their students as possible.",5/23/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

The T.A.s including Josh are also great at turning seemingly complicated subjects into something you can actually understand and apply. The classroom environment is a work hard, play hard mentallity. While everyone is there to learn and make the most of their experience, Building Co. & Ironhack also have many fun events and there is lots of time to make meaningful friendships and meet some cool people.

236151,2017.0,True,Life changing,"Hey! My name is Oleh Kolinko, I am born and raised in Ukraine. Also I am a recent graduate of IronHack and now I am full time web application developer. If you are reading this review you probably want to change something in your life, considering to attend this bootcamp and debating if it is worth it or not? Is it the right school for you? I was in your shoes and after graduation I can say 100% confident that going to Ironhack was one of the best decisions that I made in my life! The most important investment you can make is in yourself. 

Before IronHack I studied two years in University majoring in Computer Science and I dropped out. I was working regular jobs, but I always was interested in technology so I started learning how to code on my own. It's a great way to start but If you want make into a career It's much easier with a real mentor and help from professionals. Compared to my University IronHack teaching the latest trending technology like MEAN stack and that's exactly what employers are looking for.  

Learning process: your everyday routine will be starting with lectures and after more importantly - practice. You do some exercises in pairs and then individually. Lead instructor is Nizar - absolutely great teacher! He really knows what he is talking about and excellent with explaining, giving analogy examples to simplify things, and ready to help when you struggle. During lectures you can ask any question at any time. In class you will code along with instructor, there will be frequent stops where both Nizar and TA will make sure nobody is falling behind and everybody is on the same page. All staff is really friendly, cool and ready to help you. You can find yourself joking around with Ariel before you find out that he is actually co-founder. 

I liked project weeks the most, that's where you apply everything you learned and build your own application. You come up with an idea, design database structure and app architecture. I learned how to manage your project and your time (you have to meet deadline) along with public speaking skills (presenting your project). In reward:  You will get portfolio with 3 projects that will easily separate you from University grads and show employers that you actually can build fully working apps.

Your classmates will become your friends. You can find people with similar mindset and passion to create. Even having a full time job I am still working on side projects with people I met during IronHack. Also I moved in with two classmates, we extended our learning outside IronHack by helping each other after school and we became really great friends! Try to move in with somebody from your course, you will thank me later.

What can I say about job searching? - Shortly, I had two job offers just in two weeks after graduation. They have a designated man that works full time to make sure you get hired - Daniel Brito (placement manager). He knows almost everybody in Miami tech ecosystem and will introduce you to those who are hiring. You are going to learn with him how to be a real job hunter and how to crush the interviews. He can give you some additional personal advises and will be helping you even after graduation.

Sounds great right, but what's the catch? It's hard. If you are just looking for easy money that developers earn you are knocking at the wrong door. Course is intense and it's only begining, you will have to work hard to be successful. The most important skill that you need to learn is how to learn, how to be resourceful. On my job we use different tools than IronHack and you need to be ready for that. Be a coder means that you will have to learn all the time even after the course because there will be always new framework or new tool that just came out and you have to learn it. If you want to become a developer you have to love coding and be passionate about tech world.

The cohort was full of dedicated individuals who devoted 10 full weeks to becoming experience designers and this was one of the most amazing aspects of the course - the people were all amazing and possessed an incredible amount of passion and drive. That - in addition the amazing instructors who brought significant real world experience and the incredible academic environment at Building.co - made this a one of a kind experience that facilitated my growth as a designer.

I have always been a creative person that has a passion for technology and learning but I found myself unsatisfied with my prior career path, I beleive that I should be passionate and love what I do.

A close friend of mine put me onto Iron Hack, once I looked up what the UX/UI Design bootcamp could do for me I was extremely intrigued and reached out to Iron Hack to apply. Right away I was made to feel at home by the Iron Hack staff. Alia Poonawala, the director of admissions and one for the nicest people I've ever met, guided me through the admissions process and solidified my belief that I had made the right choice.

Once class began I was introduced to the whole Iron Hack staff who are all incredible people! What I learned in class was everything I had dreamed about and more. We learned the whole UX/UI process and I finally felt like I had made the correct career choice. Our instructors Joel Mena and Jaclyn Levi, both professionals working in the UX/UI field, were extremely knowledgable and did a great job of teaching us the material. Having someone who works in the field as an instructor was fantastic as they both taught us and gave us invaluable advice about the UX/UI field.

I would be remissed if I did not mention our TA, Eugy Alliegro. Iron Hack provides each cohort with at least one TA who is there to help guide us along the way and give feedback. Eugy was a TREMENDOUS help and was a key component to myself and all of my classmates learning the material and becoming UX/UI designers.

For me, having a great time learning in an incredible environment (the Iron Hack workspace is BEAUTIFUL) was enough to be happy. Where Iron Hack went above and beyond was in helping me find a job once I graduated. Daniel Brito, the placement manager, is a rockstar! Daniel (or Brito as we call him) was in our ears about what we needed to do in order to gain traction in the tech community from day one. He is someone that deeply cares about the students and does everything in his power to place us once graduated. Brito's hard work and guidance helped me land a job right after I graduated from Iron Hack!

236079,2017.0,True,A great experience,"Why I joined Ironhack

After finishing Mechanical Engineering school, I interned at a financial institution in a position related to the world of technology. I had a revelation: there is no skipping the technical skills if you want to stay relevant in the world of tomorrow. Bridging the gap between any discipline (mechanical engineering or finance in my case) and tech is among the best values that an employee can bring to any organisation. When I received a full-time offer with a 6-month gap period, I knew I wanted to do the IronHack before joining.

The experience

I was part of the the Jan 2017 Madrid web-dev full time bootcamp. IronHack’s premise is that after three months you can go from squat to entry-level programmer. This was not my goal but my expectations were still high. My aim was to gain skills that would allow me to bootstrap a project more easily. And I can honestly say that IronHack surpassed all my expectations.

Ironhack is nothing like your University experience. It’s a super-intense, hands-on experience that merges learning, doing, building and networking. A typical day would start with lectures in the morning, exercises in the afternoon, followed by a seminar by Alvaro on personal branding, back to exercises in the evening and finally beers to power through the early night. The teachers are always available and willing to help, and the class soon turns into a group of very close friends. As for the learning experience, unbound by the constraints of traditional universities, IronHack can morph its curriculum on the go to keep up with the latest demands of the market, giving you the tools to keep on learning beyond and after the course.

Overall my experience at IronHack was very positive. I think of it as the perfect complement to an undergraduate degree in any field, opening the door to a world of new possibilities. And most importantly, it was incredibly fun!

After Ironhack

I wouldn’t say my life has been completely turned around, but I would retake the course a thousand times. I will now join my firm equipped with a whole new array of relevant expertise.

236001,2017.0,True,I found a (great) job in two weeks,"I started the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid in January 2017. I graduated in Law the year before and wanted to do something different with my life. I started to learn programmation on my own with Codecademy and some other tutorials. After a few months, even though I realized that I could teach myself a lot, I still had no idea about how to launch myself into a developer career.
It feels really good to think that it was only a few months ago and that I'm now writing this review from my new job office.

I'm French and I came in Spain only to do the bootcamp. It wasn't an easy decision to invest all that money and that time. That's why I take the time to write an honest review of my experience. Reading student reviews helped me to take my decision, and I feel grateful to the people who took the time to write one. Besides, I heard that Ironhack is now launching in Paris and I really want to be a part of the french Ironhackers community :)

Basically, I started the bootcamp with little knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. In only two months, Ironhack turned me into a Junior FullStack Developper.

When I started my new job a few weeks ago, I was able to deliver something , and that felt good. Ironhack taught how to learn what I don't know and how to collaborate with a team.  That means that from the beginning, the level will be really demanding (even the best student in my cohort would agree with that!). Days are usually 10-12 hours long.

In my case, we had a new teacher every week to teach us a module. They all have a deep knowledge of what they teach and a real understanding of the professionals needs (since all of them work as developers). So every morning you'll a have class with the teacher, and every afternoon you'll put it in practice with an individual exercise and pair programming. That's probably the key of that bootcamp, a huge amount of practice. The teacher assistants, the most patient, dedicated, nice and skilled people you'll ever meet (really, where do they find them?) will help you to accomplish what will often seem impossible.

You'll code real projects. In my bootcamp, everyone made a game after two weeks (and some of them were quite impressive). We also made two websites: the first was to sharpen our back-end skills and the last one was a complete application using Node & Angular 2. In my case, I realized a project for a Madrid's Startup that is now a finalist in a local contest.

At the end of the bootcamp, Ironhack team presented us to 20 companies from the local scene. Being able of showing real projects is certainly what made that many of us found a job then, and that Ironhack hiring rate is so high. In a broader scale, Ironhack's success comes certainly from its high sense of community (you'll quickly learn about the Ironbeers;). I mean that in my bootcamp I had a great time with the other students and we still party together. In that matter, Ironhack definitely has spanish DNA. But it's more than that. In my case, Ironhack organized events where I got to meet people from the most interesting Startups in Madrid.

I have no doubt that Ironhack Paris will be as good (if not better) than in the other cities. If you have any question, I'll be happy to answer it!",5/11/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

235986,2015.0,True,Best Decision I've Made,"I really hate school. I have always liked learning and making things but the way that I was taught at school really deterred me from pursuing any of my interests. I tried for around a year to teach myself to code from videos on different sites like Udacity and similar ones. I felt that although I had gained a lot of individual abilities and skills, I still felt uncomfortable building a deployable and usable application. Even worse I felt that I would never feel comfortable applying for an actual job with my set of knowledge. I decided to join Ironhack and it was the best decision I have ever made. The facility is awesome and was a fantastic place to both work as well as cool down during breaks. The rest of the students were all pretty cool and smart for the most part which also made the experience even better. The course does not only teach coding. It also actively ensures that you connect to members of the local tech community. Furthermore, they help you write your resume, make your linkedin, lecture you on interviews, and do countless other things to make you more easily hireable. I have never felt so confident in getting a job in my life. However, the absolute best part of Ironhack to me was the staff. It was a bit of a family and every single person in it was just on another level of nice. Even more than nice though we were always laughing and joking and getting genuinely enthusiastic about programming. The owner of Ironhack Ariel was around a lot of the time and he is one of the most genuine and respectable people I have met. The staff all around were just great people and great teachers. I learned so much and feel like I am picking a job now as opposed to finding one. Even further, I feel confident to run my own applications and sites all by myself.

I've learned much more than I could have hoped to with an equivalent amount of time on my own, and made great friendships and connections throughout the process. Both in Ironhack and the local tech scene, which they are very well integrated with (Go Brito!).

I highly recommend this course to almost everyone desiring a career in or related to software development. I say ""almost"", because it is absolutely essential that you be a passionate self-starter. This course is a shortcut only in time, not effort. If you expect to put in minimal effort and get a job immediately upon graduation, especially with little or no prior programming experience, you will be sorely disappointed.

235983,2017.0,True,Ironhack Review,"Last year of college, studying accounting and preparing for a life filled with debits, credits, and T-Accounts... Decide to pursue a scholarship opportunity in a field I'd always wanted to study but was never taken serious about it by others. The scholarship was being given by Uber to attend Ironhack's school of UX/UI .  I Make it past the first round, then the next, then the next. A month later I actually win it, and I'm in an amazing building (literally called building) surrounded by dozens of like-minded individuals that all share the same passion for entrepreneurship, design, and development. This is the place I'd meet my future UX Design lab co-founders, the place I'd meet the best career placements manager in all of Miami, and the place I'd unlock my hidden potential I've always been too scared to chase. From the instructors to the management, Ironhack was truly a gateway to an industry I thought I'd never be apart of.

I made the mistake of not pursuing a degree in graphics/design 3 years prior, but this one decision made it all worth it. I was able to apply years of business experience to a user centric design role and excel in all my course work. The instructors guided me every step of the way, particularly Joel, a master of his craft. Here I learned the foundations of good UX, and the ebb and flow that ties it with UI. I was given foundational lessons on industry standard software, that I would then go on to master on my own. All while never forgetting the last thing Daniel Brito (placements manager) said at our orientation. ""You get what you put it."" Boy was he right. Hours upon hours, days upon days. I grinded and gave it everything I had. I built a portfolio strong enough to challenge senior positions. I built a company with classmates, good enough to be contractually hired within a week of incorporating. I began a path I'd never look back on, and In the end, it was only right that Daniel Brito would be the one to connect me with what would go on to be my first professional full-time (benefits, and a hell of a starting salary) job as a UX/ UI Designer.

235977,2016.0,True,Ironhack,"Before attending Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp, I was working at a law firm with the aspirations of becoming a lawyer. Right before deciding what law school to attend, I began doubting my decision to pursue law. I had a yearning for learning and creating that my chosen profession at the time could not provide. I had always dabbled with computers and very basic HTML/CSS but always thought that pursuing web development as a career, would require a bachelors in computer science. I started researching alternatives to the traditional route of web development education and found Ironhack. Right from the first interview, I knew that the program was right for me. What makes Ironhack distinct from many other bootcamps is that they gear you for success right from the first interview. Placement into a cohort is dependant on passing a technical interview. It is very important that a potential student meets the technical criteria before attending the bootcamp because the material and course is not easy! After placement, there is a very hefty load of pre-work which I believe is just as important as the 8-week course itself. Completion of the pre-work is essential! The 8-weeks that follow move fast but there is plenty of help and support along the way. Each topic is taught by building on what was previously learned. The the last 2 weeks, which are dedicated to the final project are when all the concepts are really ingrained into your memory. Overall, the experience is life changing to say the least. Ironhack really does care about their students and graduates. Upon graduation, you will have top-notch career support to get you working as a developer, and access to a HUGE network of Ironhack alumni.",5/9/2017,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

The pre-work gave me a foundation to start the course. Loved the teaching style and the instructors are amazing, the TA's were also very helpful. After the bootcamp I received great guidance from career services in order to prepare my resume and LinkedIn profile. Kept coding and practicing on my own in order to prepare for the interviews. Then came the interviews, I felt prepared and confident. Landed a Jr. Full-stack developer job after 2.5 months of completing the bootcamp!

235971,2017.0,True,Coding - more fun than you could imagine!,"My name is Walter Monecke and I recently graduated from the german University of Bayreuth.

I studied business but wanted to get into more technical stuff.

I read A LOT of reviews and the coding school that had the best reviews by far was Ironhack and I am writing this review to confirm it.

Ironhack is a coding school that teaches small groups (up to 14 people) to code in a very efficient way. Not only do you learn to really code and put out one project after the other, but you also make great contacts with people in the industry, so it is WAAAAY easier to find a job than being on your own. And yes many of my friends already have jobs. I do not have one because I chose to work on my own projects and follow the entrepeneurship that was always within me.

Ironhack teaches industry standard technologies like for example the MEAN-Stack and throughout the course you do three different projects on your own that help master each one of the tools that compose the whole stack.

By the last project, i.e. number three, you actually create a full web-app. You come up with the idea, you use your creativity and your learned skills to actually develop it.

I cannot tell you how much Ironhack changed the course of my life and how much I am grateful to have discovered this hidden passion for code. I am happy I can wake up and start building something out of thin air and say ""This was done by Walter!"".

Having a computer science major is cool. Having gone through this bootcamp is better.

Ironhack is a family to me and I will be always be a proud alumni.

 

PS: If you apply and get accepted I cannot tell you how important it is to do you pre-work.

235947,2017.0,True,The best way to jump-start a coding career,"I recently graduated from Ironhack's full-time Web Development Bootcamp in Miami, and have them to thank for my new position as a JavaScript developer. Above all else, Ironhack taught me how to work through errors when I encounter them, and where to find the information I need when dealing with new technologies. I had the pleasure of learning under the instruction of Nizar Khalife Iglesias, and attribute my success thus far to him and our T.A. Ariel Deschapell. Nizar is incredibly patient, and his knowledge of the subject material is impressive. Ariel is equally patient, and was an excellent resource when I needed guidance. As a whole, the Ironhack staff went above and beyond with any request I brought to them, and were always easily accessible. The classroom environment allowed me to build long-term friendships and experience teamwork in the context of software development. Throughout the duration of the bootcamp and after its conclusion, Ironhack's Placements Manager, Daniel Brito, committed himself to helping me launch my career. Daniel sacrificed tremendous time and effort to both teach me how to job-hunt, and generate leads for me to pursue. He delivered on every commitment he made, and exceeded all of my expectations.

235913,2017.0,True,Amazing Experience,I recently graduated from the UX/UI  full-time bootcamp. It was an amazing experience. The class structure and the instructors were great. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to enter the field regardless of your experience!,5/3/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
235893,2017.0,True,"Changed my life, forever.","I had just been fired from a restuarant I worked in when I heard about 'coding'. I saw the ""learning to code"" video with Mark Zuckerburg and all those other CEO's and I was inspired to learn... After a few weeks of CodeAcademy learning HTML & CSS, I got curious and clicked on an ad mentioning a school in Miami that taught development over the course of 9 weeks.

To everyone's surprise, it was actually Wyncode! I immediately clicked on the link, reviewed their site, tuition, and material. I even signed up for their  ""Learn to Code in A Day"" event where they taught basic Ruby... At that event, I met a guy who was also at the course trying to build his site. I told him my interest in Wyncode and the developer role where he immediately told me that if I was going to pay for a school, it should be Ironhack. 

That was when I learned, that Ironhack is one of those schools that could have their doors packed with people & students if they really wanted to. But they don't! They have a selective acceptance process where they try to weed out those that want to 'code' and those that have a passion for technology + code. 

It didn't occur to me at first but, that had been the single most luckiest and best decision I had ever made, choosing Ironhack. 

And I can say that, why? Because I experienced both. Not only did I go to the ""Learn To Code In A Day"" but my brother, who also wanted to develop, took the web-dev course, but at Wyncode. 

So here's my perspective on both, no strings attached. 

Ironhack's taught me how to be more comfortable with computers, code, and manage software and its architecture. It gave me a chance to really sit down with technology and learn the in's and outs, talk the talk but also walk the walk...Of course, every web-dev program will (hopefully) do that. 

The caveat is the people. The people here at Ironhack are phenomenal. From the lead instructor Nizar, to the wonderful ladies who tidy up the place when they need to; it was all wonderful. At first, my biggest fear was having this program be more oriented around business than the actual 'learning' part of everything. Kind of something like where you walk in, they teach you for 9 weeks and thats it, just a ""good luck! goodbye!"" That fear was immediately laid to rest when I met the team. If we are talking just culture, not even considering quality of the education, Ironhack has it down pat. These people truly care for you, and your future, as if your fate was their own. I have seen many of them go beyond their 'work' requirements to help a student in need; whether that be staying late to clear up some confusions for students or at times carpooling to a networking event. The Ironhack team is a team of focused, determined, and compassionate individuals who will get you to where you want to be, in your career. 

Now, lets talk about the education. Nizar is the lead instructor here, and was the main instructor in my course. The man is brilliant. Extremely patient with students, gives you room to fail and make your own mistakes when you need to but also catches you when you're going to fall too deep. The course itself is really well built, you pretty much have a couple hours of lecture everyday where they introduce you to the new material, followed by a pair-programming exercise and a do-alone exercise. We were also the first cohort where they introduced two other main projects to, whereas before you only had one final project that you had to present and demo for your graduation. This was one aspect that I feel Ironhack really excelled in. These first two projects really taught me a lot, not only about the actual code but also things like time management, soft skills and working with others, asking for help, etc that a lot of other courses didn't get to fully experience. Nizar does a phenomenal job taking care of his staff + students, and the quality of education really reflects that.

Now, what about finding a job? They have a placement manager here, Brito, who's job is to connect you to companies who are looking to hire developers, and kind of get the ball rolling... Daniel Brito is one of Ironhack's greatest commodities, because he knows everyone in Miami and will go to extreme lengths to putting you in touch with the right person/company.This guy could sell water to a ski-boat if he wanted to. He pushes you to be just like him, a go-getter. He willl call you non-stop to make sure you sent the right email, he will chase you down to make sure you applied for the right company and he will give you the necessary butt whooping if needed. The guy has experience, has been in the tech business for some time, and is super well connected and has those relationships that are really necessary when looking for employment in the tech-industry. Plus, he's funny as hell. 

In the end, my brother needed to go back and re-learn a bunch of the material after his graduation. Till today, he calls me and asks for help and an extra pair of eyes for his code. And we took two different courses, almost simultaneously. 

All in all, Ironhack has a top of the line team with top of the line skills, and anyone who walks into the building can tell the second they walk in. It has changed my life and the way I look at it, completely. I will forever be in-debted to some of the people here that were so patient and took their time with me.

235781,2017.0,True,Great course if you love development,"Iron hack was an excellent experience for me, the most important thing I gained was the high level understanding of development and the current technologies that exist within web development. Now if I hear a client say they need xyz I automatically understand what tools could provide them with a solution. When I look at a website I understand the components that make up that website. 

The instructors are extremely patient, the T.A.s are very helpful and the staff in general (including one of the co-founders who could be seen there regularly) make you feel very much like you are part of the Iron Hack family. This school is effectively filling in the gap in an industry that badly needs it. While many online courses will teach you syntax and many college courses will teach you theory, at Iron Hack you will gain the practical skills necessary to enter today’s workplace and build a portfolio of your work.

One of the most valuable parts of Iron Hack is the Placements Manager Daniel Brito and the services he provides. These services go beyond job placement, you will learn how to become part of the South Florida tech ecosystem (which I didn’t know existed before this course) which is essential in the development of your career. Here you will meet other developers, business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs. 

A word of advice for people who want to take this course however: you need to learn more than just coding syntax prior to entering the course if you want to really take advantage of everything it has to offer. Prior to taking the course you should be able to solve problems using programming (javascript would be great but if you can do it in any other language it will be extremely helpful since you already understand the logic behind problem solving using code). Don't take this course just because you heard you can get a good paying job as a developer, take it if you like to learn about programming and you enjoy spending hours doing it.

Ironhack allow me to find a job as web developer quickly and this was the most important for me.

The most interesting for me was that the teacher are profesional. They come from Spotify, Ebay and Xing and they teach us how to code, but also how to do a job interview, how they work, some tricks they use all the day.

It has been also very important for me, that they teach me how to test code and agile methodologies.

The staff has been a very big support for me. It was composed by the TA's(Teacher assistant), the bootcamp manager and the funder (Gonzalo). They help me a lot to improve my professional profile and making it attractive for the IT ecosystem.

235615,2016.0,True,Ironhack Miami is the reason I'm where I am today,"Moving down to Miami from New York was one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life, however I completely underestimated the job market and I definitely would not be where I am today if I had not enrolled in Ironhack.  After researching and getting admitted to the Web Development bootcamp, I immediately felt as though I was kickstarting my life.  A full emersion environment with like minded individuals who all want your best interest was more than anything I had been exposed to before.  Having studied Systems Engineering for 5 years at GWU, I had never received the attention and passion that Ironhack provided me with.  The instructors as well as the TA were extremely helpful and willing to go over any bit of information that I was confused on, stuck on, or wanted to learn more about.  I never thought that in 8 weeks I would fully develop a new skill, and learn multiple new programming languages and be able to single handedly create a full functioning web application.  This is something that made me a more desirable candidate in conjunction with my data analytics and system engineering background. 
The journey only begun there, however.  The staff at Ironhack has somehow figured out a way to make each and every student feel as though they are the number one priority.  Whether it was one-on-ones throughout the course to just check on your status and how you’re feeling, all the way to standing strong with me when I was ready to give up multiple times in finding the correct job for me.  Daniel Brito specifically refused to let me give in to my doubts on finding the job culture fit for me.  Although Ironhack was amazing with placing students in positions, I wanted THE position – the ultimate job, and I refused to settle on anything less than that.  I have never met anyone who has more connections in a city than Brito, and it was almost humorous to me how almost every job I interviewed for, someone knew him and always in a positive light, which only made me have more faith.  Ultimately when I began restructuring my job search, it was single handedly the fact that my resume was in the hands of the right people at the right places that I was able to get the opportunities that I did.  And, I would not have had that advantage if I didn’t do Ironhack and have Daniel Brito as a career coach.  Having finally started the next steps in my career at a well known fashion e-commerce company, I finally feel that I am in the environment right for me with the co-workers who can help me in growing with the company and excel in my role.  And as it turns out, I got the interview since my boss had my resume on file from one of his best friends, Daniel Brito, and the with the right knowledge base and personality, I was able to secure the position.

244708,2016.0,True,I'll do it over if i could,"I was a part of the first cohort for UX/UI Design in Miami. It was only 8 of us in the class each from different corners of life.  I got interviewed by Alia a couple of months before starting the course. Alia is like the gatekeeper of Ironhack you'll most likely meet her first through the interview process and she'll help you prepare and to be ready for your first day of class. One thing I'll point out is the IronHack staff all work and blend together so well it's like they were crafted precisely to work together. It's pretty inspiring to see that, it really shows the passion they have for their job.  On my first day, I knew the decision to go to Ironhack would be the beginning of something new. Though a lot of the work and change has to come from oneself.

The first instructor to get us going was Jacqueline and the best person for the job to introduce us to user research. She was a force of positivity and encouragement in the class. I really appreciated that.  Joel another instructor had such a way of keeping one curious kept me always wanting more. Mr. Marcelo the instructor who came in after Jacqueline an amazing designer. All his vast amount of knowledge was golden. Josh our final instructor for the Front-end proportion of the course probably with highest difficulty part of the class but, still he helped us make it through, made it enjoyable, and fascinating overall.  

The classroom environment is really open and if one feels like they won't be able on the level with everyone else that shouldn't be a concern. All the students come from different backgrounds in a way that really adds to the experience overall and benefits all the students. The course is designed in a way to be accessible to all, but it is a large amount of information to squeeze into a small time frame. There were times throughout the course I felt one week feels like two weeks in one. It's partly due to the amount of information one absorbed in a small amount of time. One really has to be fully committed to doing this. Overall the people in the class helps one stay motivated and encourages everyone to really push oneself and keep going.  

The person to oversee everything in our class was Alida she made sure the class and everyone was on track all the way to career week. The preparation to career week can be a stressful time but the person to help you through it is Daniel Brito he is your cheerleader, advisor, mentor, best friend, and sensei all in one. It all ends with the Hackshow where everyone is put to the test and show's their final project to the tech community and is to judge. The journey does not end with Ironhack though, one has to continue learning once competition of the course. One shouldn't expect to master everything at their time at Ironhack it's all a process and like I mentioned it before a lot of the change has to come from oneself.

Overall Ironhack really has opened the door to the tech community for me. A month and a half after Ironhack I started an internship as a UX designer at a digital agency located in Wynwood.

244725,2016.0,True,Amazing experience UX/UI Design Bootcamp,"I attended the first co-hort of the UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Ironhack from October to December 2016 in Miami. Joining the UX/UI bootcamp at Ironhack was the best decision I could have made. If you are thinking of doing it, I would totally recommend it!

I became interested in coding and UX design after attending the Women’s Code Weekend where we learned basic front-end development. From that event, I fell in love with coding and Ironhack’s staff. From the founder (Ariel) to all the staff, you can tell they enjoy working there. So there was no hesitation that this would be the best coding school option for me. After that event, I attended a couple of introductory events and an open house event were admissions (Alia) was able to help me make the right decision.

The co-working space (building.co), where Ironhack is located, is an amazing space that also hosts Tech startups. They host events that you can attend and this helps you become part of the Miami tech community. Also, Jenny, the co-working space manager, is amazing! 

Before starting classes, we had a week of pre-work to get started with the basics of design. My class was a small class (8 students) so we received very personalized attention. My classmates came from very different backgrounds and we all had different strengths which was nice. We had two amazing instructors (Jackie and Marcelo) that each have over 15+ of experience. During the bootcamp, we had lectures during the morning and hands on practice during the evenings, which in my opinion is a great way of learning.  I think the curriculum was very thorough. And also it is nice that every other week you have a one-on-one meeting with the staff to make sure you are doing OK. Alida, the operations manager,was there with us to make sure everything ran smoothly. 

Wednesdays were my favorite day, because we had guest speakers who had years of experience in UX Design. Through the bootcamp, I was able to make great connections and to meet a lot of people involved in the tech and startup community. 

We had one week of front-end development (more specifically HTML5 and CSS3) which I wish we had more! Josh was an amazing instructor. 

We had a career week, which was a great experience. Daniel Brito did an amazing job bringing companies to interview for UX design positions and preparing us for these interviews. After this I received a couple of offers and at the end landed a great job at Visa.

235402,2016.0,True,Life-changing experience,"I first heard about Ironhack from working in the coworking space where it is headquartered. I would see the students in the classroom from sun up until sun down with terminals and web browsers open, furiously typing away at their keyboard. I'd dabbled with learning how to code in the past through sites like Codeacademy and Udacity without much success, but working a full-time job meant I couldn't sign up for the course even if I wanted to. A month or so after telling myself it just wasn't meant to be, I received news that Ironhack was introducing a six month part-time course for the first time ever. 

I proceeded to look at the time commitment involved. Tuesday and Thursday nights and half of my Saturday for six months? I could totally swing that. Again, the money wasn’t an insignificant issue, but how many more times would I be telling myself “Maybe next time”? How much longer could I go about seeing the developers at work go about their ways and find myself regretting not having pursued this endeavor years ago? How would I feel seeing the students in the program presenting their projects six months from now and knowing I could have been a part of it?

I submitted my application and was contacted by Alia, Ironhack Miami’s awesome Marketing & Community Manager, to schedule an interview. We spoke that same day, where I told her my reasons for applying for the program and how it would help me grow as a professional and as a person. To potential applicants, think of it less as an interview and more as a conversation.

After that, I scheduled my time for the second stage of the application process, the technical interview. Alia sent me an email with links to the material I would have to study, and when I wasn’t at work, I had my head down focusing on absorbing as much of the content as possible. When the day of the interview came, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t incredibly nervous about what task I would be assigned.

Nizar quickly proved that all of my fears were for naught. He walked me through the steps required to complete the task and offered to help if at any time I became confused, frustrated, or just hopelessly lost. Luckily, it didn’t come to that due to the thoroughness of the study materials, but it says a lot about the quality of a program when its instructors understand how intimidating this part of the process can be. I won’t describe the nature of the practical interview for the sake of keeping it fair for future applicants, but trust me when I say that the Ironhack team will give you all the preparation you’ll need.

I received my acceptance email the next morning and immediately paid my deposit so I knew it was real. A few days later, I received access to the platform I’d be using to complete the pre-work and some information on Day 0, the unofficial first day of the program.

The pre-work was challenging but presented at a pace that helped facilitate learning of the early fundamental concepts. This allowed me to walk into the class the first day and follow along with the coursework we were presented with. The teaching sytle was incredibly hands on, a combination of lectures and practical exercise to solidify what we'd learned that day. The instructor and TAs were always available to answer any questions in a matter that further helped facilitate learning - instead of providing a direct answer, they would ask questions themselves and guide you to think of an appropriate solution. The learning platform was available 24/7 with all of the lectures and exercises covered in class to help get as much practice as necessary. 

The course did reach a level of difficulty that had me wondering at times whether I was meant to pursue this path, but the Ironhack staff consistently encouraged us to keep pushing forward one day at a time, all the way until it came time to work on our final project. That's where all of the topics we'd covered over the past few months accumulated into one concentrated effort - we were able to achieve things we'd never before imagined possible with code, bolstered by the support of the instructors, the mentors we were provided with, and each other. It was at this point that I also realized how strong of a bond I had made with my fellow classmates - we were always willing to help one another with any tricky issues that would come up and celebrated each other's success. 

The Hack Show served as a celebration of all the work we'd put in, where we each showed the collective product of our effort to a huge audience made up of friends, family, and members of the Miami tech community. I actually ended up winning the show with my project which was a huge surprise and sense of joy, but the overall purpose of the evening is to be proud of what we've done, not to chase a prize. 

The connections made throughout the program are nothing short of phenomenal. Daniel Brito is a veritable juggernaut at getting students to push themselves as hard as possible and matching them with phenomenal web development job opportunities. We were also connected to hundreds of other members of the tech community through various Slack channels we were invited to, only helping to further foster the sense of belonging. We entered the program as outsiders and left as essential parts of the Miami tech community as a whole.

233573,2016.0,True,After Ironhack my life changed.,"Where do I start? Let's see.. I was a creative millennial 5 years deep into a dead-end executive recruiting career . The cubicle life  (with the added pressure from the sales position I was in) was something that literally ruining my health.  I've always been more of a creative, artistic type of person so the 'old fashioned' corporate environment  was something that was hard to adjust to and, quite frankly, seemed outdated. My passion for creativity has led me from quitting my recruiting career to enrolling and completing IronHack’s 1st ever UI/UX Design cohort in Miami this past December. I found out about Ironhack through my Tech Recruiting network and my life has drastically changed for the better. 

My UX cohort at Ironhack was one of the best things for me, partly because I was introduced to a small group of like-minded people who all wanted to have a career in the tech world. Every single person on the staff is amazing and thanks to people like Alia and Alli, (two people I interacted with on a daily basis) the environment felt genuinely warm from the very beginning. 
For 3 months I went to class and learned how to become a UX Designer. I used Ironhack's facilities, met awesome classmates, ate plenty of free food, and partied plenty during the long weeks of learning UX Design. Not once did I dread going to class, because I was learning something that was more inline with my skill set. The instructors Jacqueline and Marcelo were absolutely amazing and made sure to spend extra time with everyone individually to make sure they were up to speed. I cant say enough about how well the curriculum was put together. 

I know it is very possible to learn coding and even UX Design on your own, but no amount of studying is going to introduce you to the network of of Developers and Designers that Ironhack has to me - and that I give a lot of credit to Daniel Brito, the Placements Manager at Ironhack. He's the one who not only finds our instructors, but he works his butt off to find you a job once you have graduated. Like seriously the dude loses sleep because he grinds so hard working with CEO's,  Sr. Developers, and other Sr. members of the tech community JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A JOB. My professors and instructors were leading Sr. UX Designers in the industry who have not only helped me in the classroom, but also to this very day, well after graduation. They were awesome and really great job giving you information from experiences that researching Google could'tSo if you are worried about taking that leap and being able to find work , rest easy knowing that there are people like Daniel Brito who have your back.

After completing Ironhack it took about 30 days to find a job making double what I was making before, with none of the stress. I do admit I was blessed, obviously every story doesn't have a happy ending. But I do know I would not have been able to make the strides or the money that I'm making now if it were not for Ironhack. I encourage anyone who is having second thoughts or who is afraid to take that leap into the tech community check out Ironhack.

Jackie and Marcelo taught us everything they knew. We were able to form meaningful bonds over the time of the cohort which grew from a teacher/student relationship into a beautiful friendship and mentorship. Everyone in the industry spoke wonders of them and it was an amazing experience learning from some of the top talent in the industry. I truly felt like this was a once in a lifetime experience. The staff at IronHack always went above and beyond what was expected. It is a rare chance to see such a well functioning team. You can tell each and every staff member loves what they do and are so happy. That was not always my experience. Having people doing what they love makes all the difference. They never missed a beat AND in the rare occasions where there was a hiccup, they remedied the situation almost immediately. The classroom environment was a very pleasant learning environment. What I loved most was how everyone came in with such different professional backgrounds. It was a very collaborative learning environment and not competitive. We all had the same goals which was to learn the material so it was nice to see such a supportive environment amongst the students. Months later, and I am still so happy that I joined this cohort and learned all these valuable skills. I am currently in my first semester at MBA school and I feel that this has given me such a unique skill set that definitely sets me apart from my peers. It has come so much in handy in all my classes as technology is such a key part of all business industries.

232913,2016.0,True,"Simple, the people","In the beginning, I had my doubts about it all: being able to code fully-functional websites and web applications in 8-weeks? Nah, man, that's impossible. However, the proof may be in the testimonials or the successful graduates that got jobs. That may be big selling points. 

However, for me, the biggest selling point was the staff and my cohort.

There was never a day in my rigorous 8-week long tenure at Ironhack that I didn't feel like I was among family. In fact, there were often times where I would stay after hours, not only to keep pounding the keyboard but also to bond with these people. There was a ""hidden"" feature that I had no idea about: how despite going through one of the most challenging, life-changing experiences of your life you will also come out with an extended family out of it. And I dare say, I owe my success at Ironhack, in huge part, to the dedicated, kind, and thoughtful staff as well as my dear cohort who to this day are still part of my crew.

There are countless reviews that attest to the effectiveness of the boot-camp (the pros and cons about it all). Even though not one experience is the same, I could easily identify myself with many of the major points in the reviews you'll find here--with the obvious exception of the personal parts.However, I cannot stress enough how crucial the people there were to my successful graduation. There are always there for you, whether it's for help on your coding exercises, or even when you just need a friend there. I can't find a way to say it without getting any mushier that I've already gotten, but I felt I was home. 

Similar to many other success stories, I got hired! However, not as a coder... I was hired as an IT Recruiter. Although it doesn't directly align with coding I wouldn't have gotten the job if I didn't have the technical background and tech-savvy that Ironhack equipped me with. That's right, folks! You don't have to become a programmer to put your knowledge from Ironhack to great use. SHOUT-OUT to Dan Brito, placement manager at Ironhack and dear friend, and the rest of the Ironhack team (Ariel, Alia, Nizar, Nick, Marisa, Josh) for being there through every single step of the way to getting hired. From my very first day at Ironhack, to that fateful day I received my offer letter.

That's only but a minuscule taste of what Ironhack has to offer, though. If you do decide to join Ironhack, just make sure that you practice a little coding before you go into it.

234855,2016.0,True,Fantastic curriculum and wonderful staff!,"I recently graduated from Ironhack's first UX/UI cohort in Miami. It was a life-changing and wonderful experience, which has already helped me transition into the tech world as a UX research analyst and designer. They don't call this a bootcamp for nothing: a LOT of material is covered in the eight weeks of coursework! There is a tremendous amount of information to absorb, perhaps too much, but the material is accessible even to complete non-techies like myself as long as students are willing to commit the time to study and work hard outside of class. Here in Miami our course was taught by two main lecturers who are both seasoned in their work and inspiring. In my opinion, studying alongside these experts in the field and being able to ask them questions as we progressed through the course material was what made Ironhack such a valuable experience. Jacqueline Stetson Pastore and Marcelo Paiva were wonderful teachers and continue to be mentors who are available to all members of our cohort. In addition to the incredible instruction, I was blown away by Ironhack's staff: each person who I came into contact with at Ironhack is intelligent, helpful, trustworthy, and genuinely concerned with empowering their students to change their lives. Our UX/UI teaching assistant Alida Gagliuffi kept the group (and, when necessary, the teachers!) on track to ensure that we kept up with the demanding curriculum, and the Placements Manager Daniel Brito worked tirelessly to connect Ironhack students with employers in the community who had UX/UI needs. The final ""career"" week of the Ironhack bootcamp culminated in a job fair on campus where 7 students interviewed with 10 companies. To me, that alone was worth the bootcamp's expense!  All in all, I had a great time at Ironhack. I am thrilled to be embarking on a career in web product research and design and I feel well prepared to begin that work after studying with Jacqueline and Marcelo. The only aspect of the course that I did not like was the pressure to participate in a public hackshow after the course had already ended. I felt that the public hackshow pitted students against each other and disrupted the supportive (almost family-like) dynamic that had been in existence up until that moment. Ending the bootcamp on that note seemed much more about Ironhack publicity in the community than it did about students' actual projects and work.",1/17/2017,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
233562,2016.0,True,"Ironhack, a life-changing experience that I almost reject","It was December 4, 2015, when I heard the bad news: the public relations agency where I was working at suddenly went into bankruptcy and hundreds of people, including me, were laid off. Yes, this kind of things happens very often and when people lose their jobs they simply look for a different one. However, my situation was a little different as working at this company had been my dream.

So, here I was on January 2016 looking for a “new dream”, one that could not be torn apart so easily and big enough to keep me motivated. I wanted to take this setback in my professional career and turn it into an opportunity to grow. I have always enjoyed solving problems as well as trying to understand how the technologies that have marked our lives nowadays work. It was at this moment that I realized that I could make an interesting mix with these two ingredients by learning how to code.

I started looking online for possible ways to get into coding and that’s how I found out about Ironhack. I read excellent reviews about their programs, instructors, staff members and facilities, which motivated me to visit their campus in Miami. I was welcomed by Alia (Admissions), who kindly explained me everything about their coding school. At some point, after being amazed by her charisma, I even thought that Ironhack was too good to be true — Was it possible to learn how to code and launch a web application after only 8 weeks? Were their graduates really landing cool jobs with competitive salaries in the tech industry? I honestly was skeptic about it.

That day I also met Ariel (Co-Founder), who shared with me his vision and explained how he, coming from a family of educators, wanted to change the world of education. It was something that I had never heard before.

My visit continued with a tour around the facility and then I spent a few minutes talking to some of the students. It caught my attention that there were many students from different backgrounds and even different countries, including India! Why would someone from the other side of the world come to Ironhack to learn how to code? Maybe the reviews were true, maybe they knew what they were doing.

And that’s when something inside me said that I should give this a try. I was already aware that as part of the admission process first I needed to do a general interview and then a technical interview. Of course, I spoke with Alia for more than an hour, enough to come to the conclusion that my personality was “ideal to handle the intensity of the bootcamp”. That only left me with the technical interview before I could be considered for a seat in the March 2016 cohort. We scheduled my technical interview with Nizar (Head Instructor) for the following week and then I left Ironhack with the feeling that I had done the right thing.

Alia had sent me an e-mail with the material that was going to be covered during my technical interview. During that week, I spent at least 6 hours a day going over the JavaScript concepts and exercises. I must say that this was the first moment that I felt overwhelmed about programming. There were some concepts hard to understand and some exercises that I didn’t even know how to initially approach. And then the day of my technical interview finally came and I felt that I wasn’t ready. I was parked outside the school, debating if I should really do it or not — “What if I suck?”, “I don’t want to embarrass myself”, “Maybe I should just go home” — Unbelievable, what was I thinking and since when I was so weak? I was about to give up on this without even trying. No, no, no, I took a deep breath and walked in to finish what I had started.

Nizar, who by the way is very fluent in English and Spanish, explained me the format of the technical interview: I had to solve a coding challenge with 5 iterations and I was allowed to use my notes, but there was a time cap (I don’t remember if it was 15 or 30 minutes). While I was working on the challenge, I realized that I knew more than what I thought. I was able to finish the first 4 iterations before I ran out of time. Yes, it was challenging, but it wasn’t that bad. Nizar reviewed my solution and gave me good feedback. I could felt right away that he had the vocation of teaching.

A few days later, I got an e-mail from Ironhack, where they said that they had reviewed my application and decided to accept me for their next cohort. Wooohooo!!! That was a small victory after being so close of simply rejecting this opportunity. Once accepted, I paid the tuition, got access to their online student platform and was sent the pre-work material. The pre-work is a module composed of four parts that covers the basics of Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As expected, in many occasions I found myself stuck with some of the exercises, but Ironhack was always available to do Google hangouts to go over my questions. This is when I met Josh (Teaching Assistant), who I knew was part of the first cohort in Miami and was now teaching others how to code. Josh, like Nizar, showed me his commitment as an educator.

I finished the pre-work during Week 0 and then we kicked off the bootcamp with Week 1. I truly loved the layout of the program and most importantly I always felt that I was surrounded by great and smart people, always willing to help me and with such an incredible amount of patience, including my classmates. Learning how to code is not easy, but when you are in an environment like this one, it makes the process very enjoyable.

By Week 2, we weren’t a group of strangers anymore, we were more like a family immersed in this new cool world. When we were not coding, we were talking about coding and in some cases listening even more about coding from other experts as every week Ironhack brought in speakers (senior developers, CTOs and CEOs) to give us insightful information about the tech scene in Miami.

Our regular schedule was from 9 am to 6 pm, but I don’t remember spending less than 10 hours at Ironhack every day. I didn’t know I was going to love coding this much. At the beginning, I was skeptic about what Ironhack was capable of doing, and now I was experimenting it. In 8 weeks, I learned how to code and I also built my first web application, but most importantly, I learned how to learn. Being a developer means that you will never stop learning and Ironhack gave me the tools to keep doing this on my own.

We concluded our cohort with a Hackshow, where everyone presented their web applications in front of 180+ people. This was a great way to celebrate our efforts and achievements, and a perfect opportunity to network as in a few days we were going to be in the job market as Jr. Developers.

And when it comes to job market, Ironhack has another killer player: Daniel Brito (Placements Manager), who is not Romero Britto’s cousin but still does cool things. Daniel helped us with our resumes and online presence, he prepared us for our future interviews and introduced us to many employers. Some of my classmates got job offers right away, and some others, like me, took a little longer. Daniel always kept me accountable and motivated to never give up. His phone was available 24/7, I called him several times late at night and even weekends looking for feedback and he always picked up the phone. You can surely tell that he loves his job, which is helping others in their quest of success.

I now have a job where I use technology to solve problems, where I’m constantly learning, and which has allowed me to improve my quality of life.

Ironhack is not only a bootcamp, it’s a life-changing experience and a family that will always be there for you. It was through Ironhack that I discovered this passion and set a new dream for my professional career.

What you get out of the course depends on how much you put into it. It is not an easy stroll through the park. To truly maximize your experience you have to be willing to put in long hours and you should know that you will hit walls of frustration that'll test your determination. The instructors are great and very helpful, but they will let you hit these walls and push you to be self-reliant in figuring out the problem. The balance of helpfulness and self-reliance prepared me well for my first gig in development. Programming takes years to learn and no bootcamp can condense that learning into a few months!

234957,2016.0,True,IronHack,"Hello IronHackers is Unai Camino.

First of all thanks for the bootcamp, because is opening so many doors for me.

I would like to express how I felt during the bootcamp.

In the prework I got basic knowledge about Ruby and Javascript, but in my opinion I would suggest to study more lessons about Ruby  and a bit deeper in Javascript.

During the six weeks studying Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS, I was so happy and motivated. I have nothing negative to say about it. The teachers were so good, seriously all the different teachers were very professional and they knew how to impact the classes and also help when I needed it, they were available after classes and even now. Whenever I needed something they replied. I give them a 10.

Also the material and the structure of the bootcamp in my opnion was perfect. To be honest it was the best course I’ve done. 
 
The final project helped me to put into practice everything I’ve learnt. Alfonso and Alex were very willing to help even using Slack. 

To be honest I am very pleased for being part of IronHack. Two weeks after finishing the bootcamp I got my first formal offer, now I am getting more opportunities and I can choose in which company I want to work.

I would like to explain and give a few advise to the next IronHacker generation:

I think is very important to do the prework with one month in advantge to get a solid knowledge of what you are going to study.

During the bootcamp I worked 12h/day weekend included and I would suggest study 14h/day. Seriously IronHack is just 8 weeks, and this is nothing, so it’s important to put in the hard work. The more you work the more you get it.

To make a good final project is very important to solid your knowledge, make a plan for it, ask teacher for advise and think about it before starting, think, think and think.

After bootcamp I came to London, I firmly recommended to go outside Spain, the good offers are here UK, Holland, Germany…. 

What I did to get a job, I download a list of all startup in London and I applied to them through emails to get interviews and test, didn’t stop until I got response. The same as the bootcamp 12h/ day sending emails, replying them, doing interviews…….
Get a plan and follow it through, if your planning doesn’t work change it, but continue with confidence in yourself until you get it.

My last point, companies know your level they don’t expect too much from you, what they want is motivation. show them your passion about programming and be very thankfull with them in every moment, that’s what worked for me and I think is the best approach.

I came to Ironhack with some previous experience coding. Before that, I was working for a marketing agency as an intern creating web layouts, I was tired of always doing the same and because of the low salaries I decided to quit and explore other educational options. After much searching I found Ironhack. It sounded challenging but I decided to apply.

Ironhack is not an introductory course, but neither is a specialization one. It's kind of what you want it to be. I would have to say two very important things: you need to love what you're doing and you need to have some previous experience. Frustration moments are inevitable during the bootcamp, but it is important to overcome them and take it with humor (something that I certainly did during these 8 weeks).

Of course, this is not something to try to discourage prospective students. On the contrary, if you like this world, doing the Ironhack is probably one of the best decisions you can ever take.

Ironhack do not guarantee you a job, but definitely it will help you finding it. During the Hiring Week you will have many interviews with different companies.

Imagine what you can do with an entire company of caring adults at Ironhack.

First off coding isn't for everyone. I don't believe ""everyone should learn to code"". I knew I wanted to code for a living so a bootcamp was the right choice for me. College is also not for everyone, but if you want to learn to code (even if you are in college) a bootcamp should be mandatory!

Ironhack wasn't the only bootcamp I applied to, but it was the only one that I felt I was talking to people who weren't just clocking in like the other bootcamps. From my first interview I loved the staff at Ironhack. They were people who treated me like a person not a prospective client. They helped me through the decision of which bootcamp was right for me, knowing it might not be with them! Thankfully for me it was.

The downsides are: 
1) 8 weeks is a really short amount of time, and there are some topics I think should have been covered.
2) Miami is still finding itself as a tech hub, so competition for true junior developer positions is tough.

That being said: 
Ironhack has a process that works. All you have to do is trust it and put in the work.

Every person on the entire staff cares and does everything they can to assist. From the first interview to the job placement help they aren't just doing a job, they want to help you change your life.

I was considering many web development bootcamps and I hardly knew anyhting about the field at the time so I made an uninformed choice based on convenience and I chose Ironhack.  Lucky for me, Ironhack turned out to be exactly what I hoped my web development bootcamp experience would be.  

There are other Bootcamps with bigger reputations, more prolific presence on the internet, or more famous graduates, but none will provide the educaitonal experience that Ironhack will.  Don't be seduced by bold statistics or sexy names.  IMO, smaller organizations care more about teaching you.  

Ironhack truly gives their students the opportunity to go 0-60.  They do not expect or require students to come in with any knowledge of coding (which is why I went to a coding bootcamp in the first place, duh)  and they don't let anyone fall behind.  While other for-profit educational institutions allocate more of their resources to marketing, branding, and cultivating relationships with hiring partners, Ironhack focuses on giving their students the skills they need to succeed in their new career.  

I'm not saying hiring partners aren't important.  But hiring partners won't matter much if your coding bootcamp doesn't teach you how to code at a professional level.

Frustration and fatigue are two big issues that you have to deal with during the whole bootcamp. It was really challenging because I haven't wrote a line of code before and I came from a very visual world. In this world, you need other approach to face the problems you find.

Ironhack will not leave you indifferent. The immersion in the course is complete, there is a moment that you realize that your world moves only around Ironhack.For me, it has been a really enriching and powerful experience. I am very very satisfied and would not replace it with anything.

I felt great by doing something which involved a continuos challenge. It really motivates me. And also, it required -and it will be unfair to forget it- a  lot of moral support from my friends and family.

233870,2016.0,True,Highly recommended web development bootcamp,"Joining Ironhack Barcelona was one of the best decisions of my life. I coded 12-14 hours per day, weekends included, and loved every second of it. I learned more during 2 months than in 5 years in university. The people were a big part of the experience being so fantastic - I was lucky to be able to study with 13 motivated peers, very inspiring and engaging teachers and helpful teaching assistants. 

As this is not always obvious in the male-dominated tech industry, it’s worth highlighting that during 2 months I didn’t think about my gender even once, since nobody ever gave me any weird comments or treated me differently for being female. 

During/after the bootcamp I received several offers for jobs and interviews in Barcelona, and got a new job in my home country. As I work as UX designer, I feel like the bootcamp has greatly improved my career, since I have now the capabilities to implement my own designs (at least front-end-wise) and the readiness to start to work as junior developer as well. I have also formed a clearer picture about all the development technologies out there, and know what to start learning next. I can highly recommend Ironhack to anyone who wants to work as a developer, or who needs better understanding about development for other reasons.",5/30/2016,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,,,ironhack
233866,2016.0,True,Best bootcamp in the U.S,"Ironhack has been the most amazing educational experience. This was the best career decision I could have made. Ironhack was the best choice for entry and transition into the tech world. This comes from someone who graduated from college five months ago and didn’t have any background in programming. Like others I tried learning myself but it’s not as effective.I live in Virginia and could have chosen to attend General Assembly or Code Mojo, but the reviews and reputation were not nearly as good as Ironhack’s.

My journey began when I started reading all these reviews and I couldn’t understand why a company would have consistently five stars. After my extensive online trolling, I decided to submit my email via the Ironhack website. Once submitted, Alia (Admissions) scheduled an interview and we spoke for over an hour on the phone. I was sold. Her personality, charisma is rarely found. Once I was finished interviewing with her, I spoke to Ariel (Co-founder), who was also incredibly charismatic and genuinely interested in how Ironhack could help me accomplish my educational and career goals. The third part of the interview process is with the Jedi Master: Nizar. I cannot emphasize enough how patient and compassionate he is. Nizar wants you to not only learn, but he wants you to succeed. I saw that in our first interview because I was incredibly nervous.

Once accepted, I paid my deposit and was sent the pre-work. The pre-work is essential because if you have any questions or concerns, that is your time to ask. Ironhack will also do Google hangouts to help. You should also attend week 0 (before week 1 starts) to ask any questions. During the bootcamp, there were many times that took me longer to understand certain concepts. But Nizar,Josh (Assistant Instructor) and my classmates were always there to explain the concepts with such an incredible amount of patience. Most importantly, both Nizar and Josh never made me feel like I wasn’t good enough.

In career terms, Daniel is your man (placements manager). He knows many tech companies and has several connections. Daniel will help you with your resume, and most importantly build your own brand, trust him he’s awesome.

The way Ironhack has laid out the learning process is: weeks 1-6 is learning (go to the website to see the breakdown), 7 and 8 are to build your own web application, which to be honest: It was difficult, and stressful. But it was completely worth it. Everyone has to present their web app during the Hackshow which was so much fun! We had over 180+ people that came to see what my fellow students and I had created (good networking).


Ironhack declines applicants for many reasons. So you have to take it seriously. You have to be willing to work hard. This bootcamp doesn’t stop and you have to be mentally prepared. There will be times that you may feel that you are not good enough, but that is completely normal because you are being overwhelmed with so much information. The good news is that everyone at Ironhack will be there to cheer you on, including your classmates (your new best friends).

Even after finishing the bootcamp, I know there is so much to learn. Ironhack gave me the tools to learn on my own for my web development career.

Just remember to trust the Ironhack process. They know what they are doing, and it works.",5/27/2016,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,,,ironhack
233854,2016.0,True,Best decision of my life,"I really hate school. I have always liked learning and making things but the way that I was taught at school really deterred me from pursuing any of my interests. I tried for around a year to teach myself to code from videos on different sites like Udacity and similar ones. I felt that although I had gained a lot of individual abilities and skills, I still felt uncomfortable building a deployable and usable application. Even worse I felt that I would never feel comfortable applying for an actual job with my set of knowledge. I decided to join Ironhack and it was the best decision I have ever made. The facility is awesome and was a fantastic place to both work as well as cool down during breaks. The rest of the students were all pretty cool and smart for the most part which also made the experience even better. The course does not only teach coding. It also actively ensures that you connect to members of the local tech community. Furthermore, they help you write your resume, make your linkedin, lecture you on interviews, and do countless other things to make you more easily hireable. I have never felt so confident in getting a job in my life. However, the absolute best part of Ironhack to me was the staff. It was a bit of a family and every single person in it was just on another level of nice. Even more than nice though we were always laughing and joking and getting genuinely enthusiastic about programming. The owner of Ironhack Ariel was around a lot of the time and he is one of the most genuine and respectable people I have met. The staff all around were just great people and great teachers. I learned so much and feel like I am picking a job now as opposed to finding one. Even further, I feel confident to run my own applications and sites all by myself. As I said, I hate school but love Ironhack. They teach you to actually create things instead of blind learning. It feels like more of an arts and crafts class than a science.

233502,2016.0,True,Hard but well worth it,"There are few things that can change your life completely; where you live, your significant other, your work, etc. For me, Ironhack was one of these things. Through all of the 20 hour days, hundreds of coffee’s and endless frustration, I became a programmer. The experience was one of the most difficult, but most rewarding of my life. I found a job the night of the Hackshow, and I am now working as a Growth Hacker for a consultancy based out of London, named Earlybird. I’m able to use the skills I’ve attained from Ironhack to code TwitterBots, and implement metric tracking tools.  I’ve also been working with Dockbit, a deployment app built on rails, building the front-end for their metric displays. 

The teachers in the program are incredibly knowledgable, and have a way of making you believe that you’re able to do everything. Along with them, the students, and outside network of companies and entrepreneurs available to Ironhack, make for an incredibly community that I am proud to be a part of.

233466,2016.0,True,I learned a lot about coding and feel confident in my abilities.,"I was a student in the 2016 Miami January-March Web Developer class.

	The admission process is fairly thorough. I really like how the interviews give you a chance to experience what the course is going to be like. After the initial interview, you will receive a basic coding lesson to do on your own. I liked how short it was and at the same time challenging. The next interview is a technical interview with Nizar, the head instructor. At the interview I had to complete a coding challenge based on the lesson. 

	This is similar to how the real course is. Each day begins with lectures and a handful of short coding exercises. The lessons are on the Ironhack servers so if you miss a day or need to go back to review you can do so wherever you are. In the afternoon, you will be given a task to complete relating to what you learned in the morning. It is a very hands on approach. You will learn how to code by coding. You will also be really good at learning how to learn to code (mind blown). Ex. It’s easy to Google a coding problem but it takes a little more skill to read and digest the solution. 
	At any time during the lectures or afternoon exercises, Nizar, Josh (other instructor), and Karen (teaching assistant) will be around to answer any questions you may have. In addition the rest of the Ironhack staff will be around if you need to talk to them. Everybody is on Slack (communication app) so if they’re not around they will most likely be online. I like being able to look up from my laptop and get help right away.
	In addition to learning how to code, you will also make friends and feel like part of the tech community. The classroom is on top floor of a shared workspace with 25 other companies. It’s really cool to see how other companies work and what they’re doing. I also like the monthly Pizza Friday. Everybody in the building gets to eat FREE pizza TOGETHER! There’s also a weekly newsletter about any tech meetups or events happening in South Florida.
	For me, Ironhack was a way to get a career in the tech industry. Alida, who is charge of operations and growth, helped us with the career searching. I had my resume and LinkedIN redone to reflect the new skills I learned at Ironhack. It’s a process that lasts until you leave the course. At the end of the learning and coding portion, there’s a week of career building activities. Different companies will come in to interview you. I updated my resume and LinkedIN a few more times.
	I feel really good about my skills and what I’m capable of coding. I’m also happy about all the friends I made in class and outside in the tech community. It’s an exciting time to be in the Miami tech industry.",4/1/2016,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,,,ironhack

In my opinion, this is very important. I still don't know how Ironhack accomplishes this, but it works. I obtained a level of motivation which I hope never ends! This is the greatest asset Ironhack gave me: the ability to be motivated. Once you're in, it is very difficult to leave the spiral of knowledge they provide.

Yes, at Ironhack you really can. 

I have to say that what I think really sets Ironhack apart from other coding bootcamps in the South Florida area (and trust me I did extensive research on this) is how much they care. They are so devoted to making sure you succeed, helping you along the way and providing the necessary support.

233431,2015.0,True,My amazing experience at Ironhack!,"Since I finished College, I had been working as a front-end developer at a company located in Menorca.

I had a comfortable job but I was learning on my own how to do the different things I was working on. Last year after 6 years working on the same place, I decided to quit. I felt I need more challenges and also that I need to improve my knowledge.

It was not an easy decision, but I had to choose between staying on the confort zone or trying to scape from it. I went to San Francisco to find some inspiration and I found that what I really wanted to do was learning at a Coding Bootcamp. After reading on the internet some reviews I had no doubt, the chosen one was Ironhack.

Now I realized that it was the best decision I have ever taken.

At Ironhack I've met 17 amazing classmates; the TA's were also great people willing to help you at anytime during the course; all the teachers that came were awesome (thanks to Quino, Fernando, Harek, Patricia and Javi Velasco for the classes, you are great teachers!); and I also had the opportunity of meeting part of the Ironhack staff, what can I say...incredible people (Álvaro, Dani, Gonzalo, Yolanda, Ariel, Marc...), thanks for all your support and the perfect organization.

To sum up, doing Ironhack bootcamp you will meet a lot of new interesting people during the workshops that happen every week You will interact with the best professionals of the industry and you will have great job opportunities after the bootcamp. During the Hiring Week 3 of my classmates and I got really good offers thanks to the companies that came in.

In my opinion don`t hesitate in joining the course if you're willing to learn a lot and have a lot of fun. It's a great chance to change your life. You'll  have the opportunity of meeting some of the best startups around and start working for them with a good salary, and that's something that doesn't happens normally when you go to study somewhere.",3/21/2016,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,,,ironhack
233427,2016.0,True,The best experience of my life.,"I had an amazing experience at Ironhack, right from the moment I applied to the moment I graduated from the bootcamp.

I had to travel from Mumbai to attend the bootcamp and the admissions team was always there to help whenever I required any documentation for my visa, whether it was the acceptance letter or a bunch of questions from my end, they were always ready to help whenever they could.

They sent out the prework as soon as I confirmed I would be joining the bootcamp and we were given weekly one on one sessions with the instructors but the instructors were always available throughout the week on Slack whenever I had any questions to ask. The prework was very elaborate and I feel that it helped me be ready for day one of the course.

On day one of the bootcamp, we had a fun team building activity and we had many of those throughout the course. All these activites were fun and interactive and they helped us blow off steam and got us ready for the morning lectures. We were always advised to go to events to network with the tech community and they also sent us emails every Monday with a list of events we should be going to.

The instructors and the teaching assistant were absolutely brilliant, they were always ready to help and wouldn't mind explaining the same thing multiple times and all 3 of them brought something different to the table. The course as a whole covered almost everything you'd need to know to develop a full stack web application and they even helped us with our presentations for the final project.

Week 9 was career week, we had interview prep and coding challenges. Several companies also came in to interview us and that was a very good learning experience in terms of interviewing for a web development job.

I traveled roughly 9000 miles to attend a coding bootcamp but not even for one second did I feel like I wasn’t at home. From the co-founder, to the director of admissions, to the instructors, to the content writer at Ironhack, to every single student that was a part of the cohort, each one of them had something special to offer that made this the best experience of my life and I’d like to thank each and every single one of them for it.",3/20/2016,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,,,ironhack
233400,2016.0,True,An amazing experience,"My 8 weeks at Ironhack Miami were a whirlwind. I came in with no development experience and looking back it's really amazing how much I learned in that short time. It doesn't feel short though when you're putting 70-80 hours in every week. I honestly think that's a realistic assessment of the time commitment, especially for someone who doesn't have a programming background. If there's one thing I would recommend to any student going in is to do the prework! It definitely sets the foundation and lets everyone in the class dive into the material at a great pace. The course was a great balance of lecture and hands on learning. Every morning we would learn enough to really dive into the exercises for the afternoon, and thats when things got really interesting! I think the most amazing thing about Ironhack is the dedication of the Instructors. Whether it was planning extra breakout sessions to go over a particularly difficult topic or them staying late or coming in on a weekend to help with our projects, I can honestly say that I've never had teachers that were so invested in their student's success. The staff is also deeply invested in our career success. The advice on how to sell ourselves as developers was invaluable and so was the interview experience from their hiring partners.

Besides learning how to program, I’ve also benefited from great guidance for my future career. Ironhack organized, on a regular basis, effective advice and workshops I could benefit a lot from.

Former lawyers, store managers, nfl players, and ivy league grads consumed the classroom. After the first day though, it was clear that we were all equals. Learning to code a new language is like learning to speak a new language. It isn't going to happen over night. Our two teachers, Nizar and Josh, were extremely helpful and patient. It felt like the same question was asked 100 times a day. In programming, it's all about understanding the connections between different syntaxes, and repeating them over and over again. Class begin at 9 every morning, and most of us wouldn't leave until 7 or 8 at night. We were all warned early on that there would be some days where we would feel completely hopeless. I definitely did. Around the 6th week though, something clicked. Things that took hours to accomplish in week 1 and 2, started to take minutes. Programming certain syntaxes became second nature. I was extremely happy with how my final project came out, and by the time the course was over, I was sure I made the right choice about going to Ironhack.",12/29/2015,Part-time Web Development,,[],,,,ironhack

233142,2015.0,True,Great school and even better people,"I would first like to say that for all of the skeptics out there: I was in your shoes, but I can vouch (as much as that counts on the internet) that the people in Miami posting reviews around the same time as me, were in fact students at the school in my cohort. This post will be somewhat long but it will be useful if you are trying to decide if coding bootcamps, and Ironhack specifically, would be a useful expenditure of your time and money.

So, who are coding bootcamps are for: 
-	People with no programming experience who want a career that is both fun and rewarding
-	People who have tried to learn coding/web-development on their own but got frustrated with how long it takes to learn
-	Burgeoning entrepreneurs who want to learn just enough to make their business dreams a reality 

Who they are not for:
-	Experienced programmers who thing OOP is child’s play
-	Humans that don’t play well with other humans

I fell into the category of those who tried (and failed) to learn this material on their own. While that previous coding experience was useful, it originally led me to be frustrated with the pace of the class. It wasn’t until later in the course that I fully understood the patience and caring that our instructors, Nizar and Josh, had for us and appreciated how slowly they moved to get us all up to the same level.
Ironhack doesn’t promise to make you an expert programmer; and it shouldn’t. Ironhack promises to teach you everything you need to know to just get your foot in the door for a programming career. They adopt a no-B.S. approach to help people who had never opened a text editor besides Word, learn to build incredible and dynamic websites. Ironhack gives you the basic knowledge of everything web-development and then gives you the hard, honest truth that you need to figure out your own path in this huge and amazing field.
Beyond the coding aspect of the course, the people and the location are incredible. The instructors and staff are there for you every step of the way, and your fellow students are there to help pick you up when you fall, because that’s the environment that Ironhack fosters. You know it’s expensive, they know it’s expensive, and it is a company trying to expand, but their product is solid and if you have the time and the money- but most importantly the drive- then Ironhack is for you.",12/19/2015,Part-time Web Development,,[],,,,ironhack

In eight weeks, I went from being an unhappy attorney to a legitimate developer and tech entrepreneur. But the journey wasn't easy; Ironhack's intensity level was about the same as the first year of law school. The pacing is relentless, and there is a lot of information to absorb.

232619,2015.0,True,Less bang for your buck,"This is a personal opinion about my experience at IronHack Barcelona. I have to introduced myself as a customer experience and product oriented person, which means that I’m very sincere with all my experiences and also try to apply all that I’ve learned as an entrepreneur with a small non-tech startup company which focus on customer experience and product development. When I like something, I’ll be the best ambassador of that product or service, but when I’m not happy, I’m always very honest about my reviews. This is part of my own personal opinion of my whole bootcamp experience. Something that I wish someone would have told me before joining the bootcamp.

Before deciding to attend to IronHack, I have had several interviews for a few coding schools in the United States that were 12-weeks courses. Unfortunately, I didn’t get enough funds to attend to the one I really wanted. Then I found about IronHack in Barcelona that was a 8-week course and which the city’s living costs were also more affordable. Also all the reviews were almost 5 stars, so I decided to apply and prepare for the journey.

I did a lot of online tutorials and practices few simple coding challenges because the previous schools that I applied to demanded to have basic programming knowledge. I was very surprised that the interview process was very easy, maybe is because the main focus of the school is to take students from 0% to 80%. I had the chance that a friend that attended another bootcamp had shared with me his experience of his pre-work of the other school. So I was kind of surprised how disorganized and how poorly made the pre-course work was. We were not even ask how we were doing with it at the time.

I wrote my own very personal review, but since one of my classmates have better english writing skills and I couldn’t agree more on what the author wrote, which its content is similar the two pages I wrote, I asked for permission for posting and editing the review. I’ll just highlight a few other personal comments starting with  to slashes ( // )  at the end of each paragraph of the author’s review.

We were supposed to be sent a overall bootcamp feedback survey, but even before that they were already asking us for positive feedback. My classmate’s review post and my personal add-ons:

“ … Still, there has yet to be any surveys sent out, yet each week we had to complete two surveys on the quality of our instructors. This speaks volumes to the quality and goals of Ironhack. Additionally, we were told that there would be extensive career help, even a spreadsheet for us to fill out in order for Ironhack to track our progress, yet, this request for a review was sent out before even a slight mention of such a spreadsheet. There’s been no career follow up, no LinkedIn or resume reviews and I am extremely disappointed, to say the least.

// Before attending the bootcamp, IronHack sent me a PDF of more than 5 slides with “career support” that was supposed to taught during the whole duration of the bootcamp.

I’m an entrepreneur, and one of the things that completly appreciated about this bootcamp is that it was meant for entrepreneurs, as their Twitter profile says, note that not a single lecture involved any entrepreneurial concept with code.

My experience at Ironhack was amazing in regards to my peers and the quality of our TAs. Despite there being only one TA per 8 students, they went above and beyond to help us out and it was so appreciated. 

// Thanks to the TAs for all their effort!

Aside from that, I entirely regret choosing Ironhack for my bootcamp experience as Ironhack has failed at their only two objectives: be a great educator and be a great business. My list of possible improvements is endless, but here are a few: 

    1    Start by actually vetting your instructors. Have them do a test run in front of you. Are they comfortable with public speaking? Do they engage the audience? Are they clear when speaking English? Are their materials written in proper English? Are the passionate about working with others? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you shouldn’t be hiring the instructor. If you wouldn’t want to listen to them on a Monday morning, don’t hire them. Period. 

// There were days that I honestly think I’d learned more in CodeSchool, that the current lecture because some of the teachers didn’t seem to be prepared or didn’t have high teaching skills.

   2    Be upfront about the condition of the work space and classroom. Ironhack should be ashamed of the condition of our classroom in Barcelona. I was ashamed when posting class pictures because the room looked so horrible and rundown, and it was. Paint chipping, the room hadn’t been swept or dusted in forever, there were maybe only three quality chairs in the entire room (how are developers supposed to code for over 10 hours a day on plastic chairs?), the room was unbearably hot and we had to pretty much protest for weeks in order to get fans which then just circulated all of the dust around the room. The projector didn’t even have a screen and it was close to impossible to follow along with the instructors having to adjust their settings so frequently. The tables were not actually tables, but rather pieces of lumber stacked on wooden posts even though the average Mac in the classroom was worth $1500. If one of those Macs were to fall and break, I think we can both say that Ironhack was not going to cover the costs.  

        // The first thing I’d learn while studying at industrial engineering: work conditions (weather, ergonomics, etc) affects productivity. I truly understand and appreciate that Barcelona is such a environmentally friendly city, but take into account that 80% of our bootcamp was not form Barcelona, and I’m from Panama City, Panama (Central America), where is 30ºC all year round, and I haven’t been that suffocated by heat in a workspace in my entire life. 6 tables, 2 fans, not enough! By day 2 there where two more, and that wasn’t even enough. I literally had to bring my personal fan until the last day of the bootcamp because I couldn’t focus on class or during my final project.  Some electric extension were laying on the floor, where easily more than 10 times people have tripped because of them. Also, as programmers that were supposed to spend 10hrs+ a day in that room, I expected to at least have basics: water and coffee. Filtered water tanks or water dispensers with filters, specially when not even people from Barcelona drink their own tap water because it is awful! 

    3    Reevaluate which students are accepted into the program. While of course more students mean more money, if you don’t have enough TAs and are unwilling to provide more, then simply get more selective and accept fewer students. Also, students who have been working as a developer and beginners are not to be in the same class. Reevaluate your mission as a school and choose an audience. The majority of the time, it felt as if the instructors were speaking to 3 of the 16 students. 

// Either you take people from 0% to 80%, or from 20% to 120%. There where students that haven’t even finished the pre-work before coming to class, and were accepted to start anyway.  A lot of them were so lost on the basic concepts. I think it may have downgraded the class for people with more experience. 

    4    Establish your worth as a school and stick to it. Although each student paid the same amount, certain students have been afforded the opportunity to retake the bootcamp. If that is the case, are the rest of the students going to get half of their money back? I didn’t think so. I, in no way, learned as much as I thought I would have and I know I would have been given more attention had I chosen one of the American bootcamps, yet a second round at Ironhack was never offered to me. Keep it fair, it’s as a simple as that. 

// The fact that there were several students that either dropped out or very lost in class and they just decided to skip some subjects and do what they could, should have never happened on the first place if the pre-work was better built and proper follow-up student/pre-work would have existed.

    5    While MOB is clearly not the correct choice to host Ironhack, at the bare minimum, if it is known that there is going to be loudly obnoxious construction the FINAL DAY OF PRESENTATIONS, the day for which we prepare during the entire bootcamp, the day that Ironhack invites guests to listen to its student’s present, you find an alternative space in Barcelona to host the presentations. It’s not that hard, not to mention Ironhack’s connections to startups with amazing presentation spaces. I’m sure those startups would have loved the exposure and would have loved to be a part of the presentations. Get creative, don’t get lazy. 

// At the HackShow, there where 40-50 people in that room, and I felt ashamed that the audience had to uncomfortable watch our presentations which such heat. Also, as a finalist for the top projects, I was very sad that not a single video was taken by IronHack, like the previous cohorts, or even t-shirts with our handles where given to all the students, to have memories about our experience presenting our final project. This may not sound very important, but if you start adding features, even as almost meaningless like the previously mentioned, you shouldn’t downgrade by taking it away. *MOB: Makers Of Barcelona, where the bootcamp was being held.*

    6    Know your audience. During our “hiring help days”, the first thing that Alvaro said was that most of us probably aren’t comfortable with networking and approaching strangers. False. The majority of my class came from backgrounds like communications, media, marketing, sports, recruiting, journalism, customer service, etc. Learn about your students before you attempt to advise them. Additionally, don’t have us go into a corner and show you our LinkedIn profiles while you tear them apart — it’s not thorough and it’s inefficient. Take the time to look at the profiles in advance, take some notes and then discuss with us. It will save both your time and the student’s.  

// I like people being realistic, but Alvaro saying that it was almost impossible to get a job in Spain as a non european, was absolutely demotivational.  Nevertheless, one of my classmates and me, non europeans, got job offers, because we manage to find alternatives to pursue success. So, don’t just say it’s almost impossible without providing work arounds. Also, how come you claim to have a 97% rate of hired students when not even 50% of the students are showing up at interviews and  with such non-existing follow-up after that?

    7    Hire more TAs. Don’t be greedy. Money is great, but a stronger reputation is worth much more and ensures longevity. Having to sit and wait 40 minutes to ask a question is beneficial for no one, especially a newbie.

// I get that some students may have slow pace while learning, but the other students that are paying the same amount of money, deserve the same kind of attention and assistance during class. If you don’t want to let anyone behind, make sure that each student is really prepared to start a coding bootcamp.

    8    Lastly, hire someone that has both customer service and teaching experience to facilitate the education aspects of Ironhack. You need them. As a former educator, most of the things that went wrong were simply due to lack of planning and experience. Even our welcome meeting was lackluster and could have been full of creative and light-hearted icebreakers designed to get everyone introduced to one another.   

// TAs had enough work as being TAs, someone that takes care of the customer experience and product is very needed so we don’t end out writing this long reviews!!!

I truly hope you view this feedback as constructive more than anything. Everyone wants to see Ironhack succeed, but without some adjustments it’s truly not worth it. “

// Couldn’t agree more with this! 

And now, one of my best friends, who I recommended to learn to code and go to IronHack, is about to take the next cohort, and I just wish he can have a better over-all experience that I’d had.

232582,2015.0,True,Probably the best investment I ever made !,"Turns out that after many years of work in a certain field I’d like to change something and focus only on doing things that keep me engaged and very enthusiastic about. Learning web development technologies was something I intended to do for a long time, but never actually took my time to just do it, I decided this is the time and I chose Ironhack based on their reputation, training curriculum and also because I really wanted to spend some time again in Barcelona :-).

I am really confident my investment will pay off, in fact I think it is one of the best investments I ever made. I met the most extraordinary group of people, my colleagues, and I learned a lot in a relatively short period of time. I never coded before, so the first week seemed like a lot to take in, but persisting in understanding as much as I could and getting support from the TAs, which are the greatest, I began to feel more at ease as I continued my learning journey.  At the end of the bootcamp my project was selected by a jury of senior developers as one of the top 5 projects in the class.

They start from the basics, and build your programming chops from the ground up. The team they have put together has become the best learning experience I've seen, and your peers will quickly become your friend circle.
There are some cons tho, but they are purely opinionated. You are going to have to want to learn, and you are going to have to be willing to stay late to be sure you grasp the concepts of the day. 
All in all, Ironhack is the premiere bootcamp option in Miami, with their talented staff and strong work ethics, anyone can sign up and be a reputable coder in just 8 weeks!",7/31/2015,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack

I am a Web Designer,Graphic Designer and a UI Designer. Over the past years i have ventured into many other work including producing Reality Shows and account manager for brands.

I chose Ironhack because of its reputation as the best Coding BootCamp in Europe and it was nearer for me since I came from Malaysia.

The methodology is good as far as it is concerned, i have never been to other bootcamps, so I can’t really say much about it. It would be nice if you can suggest extra one month or something for those beginners before getting into the main class, so everyone will be in the same level and understanding.

Teachers are good and was able to cope with all our questions and ramblings, also my classmates were totally amazing, they were part of the whole study as well, without them I don’t think I would have totally survived the bootcamp.

The things I like the most: free beers, good classmates, environment and the people .

The most difficult part for me was Coredata. Trying to grasp everything everyday was difficult, everyday we were learning something new and had no time for recap and remembering.

My final project was Menu Del Dia app which shows the menu del dia of the restaurants nearby to the user. Its a simple and straightforward app.

Too early to say anything about Careers...well i think so far so good, lets see how its goes.

I would recommend Ironhack to everyone because it’s a very good place to have a feel of what is coding all about and the excitement of it.",7/8/2015,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack
232460,2015.0,True,A unique experience,"Ironhack is certainly a unique experience, in my case I am a computer science engineer. Since the first day I noticed that Ironhack has nothing to do with what I studied at university, where what they taught was really outdated. Courses were oriented to the theoretical part and quite unrelated to what companies were demanding.

The community I created with my fellow colleagues at Ironhack is magnificent and today we remain as a small family where we all help and cooperate with each other for a common benefit.

In Ironhack you can get the ability to develop projects that you have previously thought about but you weren’t able to develop because you didn’t have the tools and knowledge you need. That was what happened to me, I have an idea before arriving and was not able to carry it out. But I could make it for the  Hackshow at the end of the course and I proved myself that I could do it.

Also they have advised me magnificently on how to orient my professional profile online and prepared me to face interviews, coding challenges and to negotiate my starting salary. 

Many friends ask me if I will recommend Ironhack and I have no doubt, it´s a great experience I wilI repeated again without hesitation.",7/1/2015,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
232411,2015.0,True,Ironhack is the best course to start a career in web development.,"I started to study Higher Technician in Computer Network Systems Management in 2010 and it was during this period when I discover the world of programming and I was totally hooked.  After that, I was working as full stack web developer in a marketing online agency where I had to face many challenges.  One day I realized that I need to stop and continue learning. My main goal was to  improve my skills developing scalable, maintainable and well tested web applications. That day, was the day I found Ironhack and I left my job to begin a new adventure.

From my point of view, Ironhack is the best course to start a career in web development. You will learn not only all the best practices and all the technologies required and used by the leading companies, but also you will be involved in a great and different experience where teachers and classmates work and practice together to get the best from every hour.

Teachers are all excellent professionals with a huge working experience so learn from them has been a pleasure and a great opportunity.

All eight weeks of the Bootcamp have been very intense but the hardest week for me was the second one, when I discover how to do TDD and it was very challenging. 

Finally, doing a final project where you can practice everything you have learned is essential. In my case, I was working in a learning platform called “Skillstep” where you can create your own learning tracks. To introduce a project at the Demo day was not my goal, so I decided to focus in learn better how to do specific parts of my application and it was good choice. Whether you want only to learn or you have an entrepreneurial profile and you want to know how to develop your project, you will find no better place.

Career support after Ironhack is excellent also, and the “Career Week” a good opportunity to get  a good job. Thanks to a coding challenge sponsored by a company that we did last week, I am waiting to close a job offer only a couple of weeks after graduating, so I couldn't be happier at this moment.",6/18/2015,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
232379,2015.0,True,Ironhack changed my life,"My experience at Ironhack was very positive one. As a minority and female with limited coding experience, I was doubtful at the beginning if I could complete the program. However, after 8 weeks, I not only completed the program, but also was able to develop a web application from scratch. 

Before Ironhack, I was in business, doing completely unrelated to programming. I even had a great fear for anything technology. One day I decided to cast off my fear of tech and started learning how to code. Though I was studying dilligently, it was very inefficient. As a responsible adult with responsibilities to fulfill, I thought going to school and learn ""how to learn coding"" in a short amount of time seemed efficient than reading posts after posts on stackoverflow.  And, I am glad to tell you that I made the right decision. 

What makes Ironhack very unique was people - my classmates, the teachers and the staff. My classmates were from all walks of life and open-minded, which made me feel ok to ask even seemingly silly questions in the class. I still hang out with some of my classmates even after the program ended. 

The teachers were great, too. Though some classes and the curriculum have rooms for improvement such as installing some programs prior to the cohort begins, the lead teacher, with knowlege, passion for coding and teaching, patience and care for each one of us, made my learning experience the excelent one. 

The staff. I decided to attend Ironhack because of the staff. Everyone was always thinking about how to create an open and comfortable environment and make the learning experience fun. They provided us many opportunites like happy hour, beach BBQ, and pinada smashing (to release our stress) for us to socialize and have some break. They also set up a weekly meeting where students can provide feedback and share their thoughts. People there were ""real.""

Lastly, Ironhack provided great job assistance. Of course, I had to do 99% of the work following their strategic advice, but they set up interviews with companies (I received a job offer from one of them), provided useful resources and followed up with me on the phone almost weekly for practical advice and encouragement. As a result, I received a few job offers and am currently working for a growing tech company (where my colleagues know the Ironhack lead instructor).

Ironhack really changed my life. 

There are many schools out there with different emphasis but I think the value of going to a coding school is to build skills, confidence and knowledge to continuously learn new technologies. Like myself, many coding school students will probably end up learning something new or maybe unrelated to what they have learned at school. Then, my recommendation is to go to a place like Ironhack where you interact with good people in a good environment where your learning experience will be joyful.",6/3/2015,Part-time Web Development,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack
232297,2015.0,True,Great Stuff!,Ironhack was a valuable experience. They managed to efficiently cover a variety of topics while creating a fun environment.  Their boot camp structure is very conducive for developing a solid coding base with the skills and knowledge to learn more advanced concepts with ease. I would recommend giving IronHack a shot.,4/12/2015,Part-time Web Development,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,ironhack
232252,2015.0,True,Challenging experience and wonderful people,"What I got out of my experience with Ironhack was invaluable.  I learned a great deal about myself, made friends with wonderful people from all walks of life, and came out with a solid understanding of the web development landscape. 

I decided to join Ironhack because I wanted to learn more about web programming and gain a new skill. My job as a consultant consisted of working, communicating, and at times leading developers so I thought getting a leg up in coding would be beneficial in my day to day activities at work.  I knew I needed to become code literate and that the best way for me to really learn programming would be to attend a course, to throw myself into the deep end. 

Into the deep end I went. My experience wasn’t all butterflies and rainbows. It was probably one of the toughest experiences of my life. There is a ton of content and it is constantly changing.  It is a very rigorous curriculum with an aggressive timeline designed to really challenge you.  It put my ego to the test, it made me feel dumb at times, and frustrated in others.  The first week and a half I felt like I had been knocked down, but this was done intentionally, which I appreciated after the fact.  It got me into gear and forced me to adopt a “can do” attitude.  From a personal development standpoint the program helped me learn how to better overcome difficult situations, how to ask for help, and to really understand how detrimental negative self-talk can be to ones progress. From a technical development standpoint I was amazed at how much I learned and how much I was able to accomplish. 

I think what really differentiates Ironhack from other schools is their amazing team and their culture of  “ the customer is always right”.  I really loved and was really impressed by the constant feedback loop they incorporated into their system.  It felt like a very intimate experience because they cared about my concerns, my thoughts, and most importantly my progress.  They wanted to make sure I was getting everything I was expecting out of the program; an attitude that was adopted by all of the faculty and staff.  Overall the instructors were superb. They were experts in their field, good instructors, and always extremely helpful and very respectful.",3/31/2015,Part-time Web Development,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,ironhack
232065,2014.0,True,One of my best decisions,"IronHack has been one of the most incredible experiences I’ve lived.

The professors were very good in their fields, always attentive and very close, although some of them never taught before. The TA (Teacher Assistant) was alumni on the first edition so he could understand our situation and helped us in every moment. However, the best of the bootcamp were my classmates. The selection process was very good because all of them were very motivated, hard-workers, fast-learners and close people. We helped ourselves in every problem, worked hard until 6am if necessary, and improved our programming skill together.

I highly recommend IronHack if you want to learn programming with top-teachers, incredible classmates and in a short period of time, but be prepared to work hard every day, because when the say intensive, it’s really intensive.

231910,2014.0,True,"A frustrating but fun experience, proportioned depending on your needs","Pros:

Barcelona: The location is beautiful and affordable. I enjoyed living there immensely, was able to meet a lot of locals, and lots of great people in general. It's also relatively inexpensive and very walkable.
Staff: People are really friendly, and I want them to succeed
Instructors: About half of our instructors were great to fantastic and we learned a ton during their weeks.
Class size: We had just 10 people in my cohort and we really felt like a family by the end.
Atmosphere: It's very laid back, and a comfortable and safe feeling space.
Network: They have a good Barcelona network, which is great if you want to live there and have an EU visa.
Job assistance for EU citizens: They have a strong network in Barcelona and can get you interviews. Instructors and speakers will also be looking out for you and helping make connections. However, once my colleagues who are EU-citizens left Barcelona they found that assistance dropped off like a cliff and there was minimal communication. 
I learned a ton.

Cons:

Staff: Despite their friendliness, communication was a huge issue. Even before class started, I missed most of the Hangouts because I didn't realize the times were being posted to Slack. Emails were not returned in a timely manner before, during, and after my session. People were defensive when offered feedback. I was often told ""So and so will contact you about your concern."" and then silence.
Instructors: Two of our instructors were awful and it felt like they just wasted a week of our time which is a big deal when you are only studying for 6 weeks. We basically had to relearn everything we learned from our first JS teacher. They made up for the bad CSS class by bringing in a great instructor later on, but it meant we lost a day of working on our final project. 
Curriculum: It was frequently commented by my colleagues that it felt like we were being experimented on too much and I agree with them. We alternated between JS and Ruby instruction and the context switching was very confusing. They started us off the bat with Ruby and OO which was completely overwhelming for most people our first week. 
Visa sponsorship for non-EU: You will probably not be able to find someone to sponsor you for a visa. I wanted to stay and it seemed like it should be doable (I was one of the strongest students in the cohort), but even though there was some interest ultimately what I heard was it's way too hard to sponsor and very few companies are willing to do it. You are limited to large foreign companies and even then it can take 3 months.
Job Assistance: Good or bad depending on your needs. I'm going to move this out of the bullet, so read on below.
We lost internet for a few days and last a ton of class time as a result. They didn't have a contingency plan so we had already lost almost two days before they found us a temp new space. Internet was pretty consistently bad the whole time we were there.

Job Assistance:

They were great while I was still in Barcelona, but as soon as I returned back to the states they went silent. I had previously decided with the cofounder that we would work on Barcelona until I left and then switch to SF. After two weeks of silence (I pinged a couple people during that time), I sent another email and this time they apologized and said it was a new guy's responsibility.

I scheduled a Skype call with the new guy and I thought maybe things would improve. Well, he sent me a list of sites with job postings. And then the next week he sent me another email with one more site with a job posting. In the meantime I was adding the jobs I applied to on to a spreadsheet so they could see my progress.

I did know that they would have less of a network in the states, but the cofounders are well connected. So I knew that it would take more effort on my part. However, job placement is absolutely crucial for any startup bootcamp, and Ironhack is expanding in to Miami. To succeed in the more competitive bootcamp market in the US, you need to cultivate relationships with companies that are specifically interested and willing to hire bootcamp students.

My expectation was that they would reach out to companies and pitch Ironhack and their students– in other words be proactive. What actually happened was they checked my spreadsheet and if they knew someone there they put me in contact. Which is helpful and I don't want to discount that, except 2/3 of those contacts were for companies were I had already gotten myself an employee referral and since their contact wasn't in a position to hire me they couldn't really provide me any assistance. In my opinion this just isn't aggressive enough because if they can't hit a high placement % then they are doing good enough.

Ironhack's response is that they are working hard and this is what they told me I'd get, so if this meets your expectations you wil be fine. If not job placement is really important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.

Tl;dr: Can be good depending on your needs. They can help you get jobs in Barcelona if you are eligible to work there, but if you want a lot of help for a non-EU job search they are limited to providing contacts to companies you've applied to. So far from my cohort the only person placed through Ironhack was hired by Ironhack.

Summary:

It was a fun experience overall, and I don't regret it. I did learn a lot despite the hiccups. However, I can't help but feel like they could have done much better and the communication was consistently a huge issue. I felt frustrated by the time wasted because of bad or unprepared instructors and bad internet. I felt like they missed a lot of important topics such as code reviewing and interview prep. And job assistance didn't meet my expectations at all. So yeah, YMMV.

231877,2014.0,True,Great Learning Experience in a Beautiful Place,"I'm an American who attended the September 2014 Web Development cohort in Barcelona. I came to Ironhack with little-to-no programming background, though I had dabbled in web design/some front-end stuff in the past and had (unsuccessfully) tried to learn some Ruby on my own. I had already applied to a few other bootcamps in the US when I heard of Ironhack, but as soon as I was admitted, I knew it was the best choice for me. Not only had they already had many successful cohorts in two different locations under their belt, they also offered scholarships for women, and a great location (Barcelona!) to boot.
I won't sugarcoat it and claim that Ironhack isn't difficult, challenging, and at times frustrating- but ultimately, these are the things that made me realize I had made the right choice. I always felt challenged, but if there was any doubt in my mind about a certain topic, the staff was always there to help and give me the support I need. While the program offers a certain degree of freedom and autonomy that might be intimidating to some, there were always people watching and making sure I was understanding everything, which was comforting.
Apart from the actual program and teachers, the connections one makes throughout the programs played a vital role in developing our skills as programmers. We connected with the local tech scene, but also learned the necessary soft skills to network in any part of the world.

Overall, it was a truly wonderful experience. I finished my cohort just a few days ago, and have received job offers and requests for interviews from many different companies around the world, which was my goal. I built my own (pretty great) app from scratch, which I would have never assumed I'd ever be able to do at the beginning of the bootcamp.",11/13/2014,Part-time Web Development,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
231772,2014.0,True,Learn in two months what would otherwise take years!,"I can fully recommend IronHack for any of you wanting to learn real-world practical programming skills in short time span. I am a Norwegian student of Computer Science, and before IronHack, I really enjoyed programming. However, every time I intended to apply some of the knowledge I had learned at university and tried to build something for myself I would eventually reach wall I never managed to succeed. No matter how many online tutorials I went through, I would always reach gaps of knowledge that were to big for me to overcome. That is the main reason my I applied to IronHack. I wanted to get exposed to the entire process of building an entire application, and be able to see how the independent elements connect with each other. This full-stack understanding is exactly what IronHack provided me with. It took all the knowledge I had previously learned about at university and linked it with each other offering the whole picture. With the knowledge I learned at IronHack, I can know build any idea that comes through my mind, or at least prototype it. 

Everything else about the program exceeded my expectations. The instructors were all from leading companies and surprisingly good at communicating in a didactic manner.

231636,2014.0,True,El mejor bootcamp al que he asistido. Una experiencia inmejorable.,"Asistí al primer bootcamp de desarrollo de iOS que han hecho los chicos de Ironhack y la verdad es que solo tengo buenas palabras para describirlo. Aprendí en solo 2 meses profundos conocimientos sobre Cocoa y Objetive-C tanto es así que tuve la oportunidad de publicar un articulo que recibió muy buenas criticas en un blog de desarrollo iOS de referencia en España y ¡¡no había programado nada de iOS antes de entrar aquí!!

Y no solo los conocimientos, hice muchísimos contactos y grandes amigos. Creo que uno de los puntos mas fuertes de Ironhack es que  te hace formar parte de la comunidad de desarrollo existente. En nuestro caso, íbamos a reuniones de la NSCoders en Madrid y así conocimos a la mayoría de profesionales de desarrollo iOS. Gracias a Ironhack conocí a mucha gente, que aun ahora después de acabar el curso, sigo en contacto con ellos casi todos los días. 

Por ultimo mencionar que a pesar de mi situación especial como estudiante universitario y que por lo tanto a la hora de buscar trabajo yo solo quería puestos de media jornada y que me respetaran el horario de la universidad, tuve varias ofertas y ahora mismo estoy trabajando desde casa a media jornada en una empresa con producto propio y en un equipo de desarrollo espectacular.",9/24/2014,Full-time Web Development Bootcamp ,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,ironhack
231611,2014.0,True,"Great experience, I highly recommend it","Excellent product. Great experience. Worth every euro.

I´ve been involved in digital products for years (VP of product in 2 start ups) and felt like I needed technical knowledge to become a better professional and a better entrepreneur.

After the Ironhack I am now capable of: 
i) digging into a complex RoR application, understanding the way its back-end works and being able to contribute code myself solving tickets in the pipeline
ii) building from scratch a RoR application using best practices
iii) having a better understanding on how several digital technologies are created, the way they evolve, grow and interact with each other

Ironhack excels in several ways:
i) Great teachers. There was consensus within alumni that 9 out of 10 teachers were simply outstanding.
ii) Great materials. Most of the alumni will be using materials from the Ironhack as a guide and as a repository of  knowledge to come back to from time to time for review.
iii) Great student selection process. An adequate mix of backgrounds, including technical profiles, entrepreneurs and technology corporations engineers has created a rich environment which contributed to both a great leaning process and an unforgettable networking and bonding experience.

I met my main goal, which was to improve in all product related aspects of a digital product start up, from product ownership to pipeline planning or technical hires.

295259,2022.0,False,Honest 24-Week Online Full-Time Software Engineer Program Review,"<p>A little about me, my previous career I was a Registered Nurse, but wish I had always gone into software and eventually landed on coding bootcamps as my attempt to become a software developer. I found it incredibly difficult to decide on which bootcamp to attend given the rising number of bootcamps out there and the high risk of many being non-legitimate. Eventually I found a few that seemed to be solid bootcamps and ultimately chose to go with App Academy based out of San Francisco/New York. If you are in the same position as I was, then you probably have researched many reviews as well and come to find that it really goes 50-50 on whether to do a coding bootcamp or not to do one. So many people say its worthless and a waste of money and how you can learn it all on your own or to pursue a computer science degree instead. Me personally? learning on my own was not going to work. Having the structure and discipline a bootcamp provides was exceedingly beneficial, especially in how they slowly advance you in learning topics. When learning on your own you get very lost in where to start and what frameworks to pick up, you end up in a constant limbo of learning small things here and there but never really gaining true knowledge of how things work. I recently completed the 6-month online software engineer track with App Academy in April of 2022. Before I started this program I spent about a month with on and off learning through websites such as Free Code Camp, Codecademy, and youtube videos. Essentially, I came in with next to know knowledge of coding. Most bootcamps are designed for people with very little coding knowledge, and build them up to speed as fast as possible. As most reviews say, attending a coding bootcamp can be very difficult and will take up most of your time. I can attest to this, It will definitely take up almost all of your time for the time you are enrolled, but I promise you it is not as hard as they say it is, it is very doable. For the 6-month online program, it was mon-fri 8am-5pm and had tests on every monday in which you need to pass to advance to the next week. You can only fail the tests or the projects (there were 4 projects total) combined of 3 times. But don&#39;t let that scare you, so many people have done this and have been successful, and App Academy does a really good job of preparing you with practice tests and office hours. They have various payment methods, which usually comes out to be around 20-22k depending on how you choose to pay. They are on the higher end of the spectrum of bootcamp affordability, but in my personal opinion, well worth it. With that said I had a great experience with App Academy and highly recommend them if you are searching for a well established bootcamp. One of the best features is that they have a career team that continues to do work shops and hiring events after you complete the program help you in your job search. I am not sure if other bootcamps do this, but this is a must, they help to keep you focused after you finish to keep learning and applying so that you will obtain that job. Don&#39;t be afraid if you do decide to choose App Academy and see that there are 100 people in your online cohort, within the first 3 weeks that number can drop in half with people deciding they don&#39;t like coding and people failing because they are not truly dedicated to learning. It is also true that most of the teachers/aides are previous students, do not be alarmed by this either, every single bootcamp does this. But do know that they have real experienced software engineers above them that also provide lectures and guide the curriculum to ensure that the correct things are being taught and that we are progressively learning. At the end of completing any bootcamp, don&#39;t expect to land a job within a few months, while it certainly does happen, it is definitely not the norm. You have to continuously work on projects/learn new concepts/study DSA/obtain certificates/ and most importantly do not stop applying to jobs. Completing the bootcamp is one part, the job search is a whole different monster, but I promise this bootcamp offers enormous help once you finish to land that job. Sorry if some of my thoughts are random through this, I am trying to put down every thing I found to be important and what I wish I had knew before I started lol. All in all if you decide on App Academy it is absolutely legit, you will learn enormous amounts, and it will be incredibly fun if you love coding. As stated above I finished in April of 2022, I just now landed a remote software engineer job this month of November 2022, it took me 6 months to land my first job and around 1000-1200 job applications. Sounds like a lot right? Many people including Computer Science graduates have this same issue in the job search. It takes a while to land that first job because everyone wants experienced engineers. Its a crappy situation, but once your in, your in. Right now the average to land that job is 6 months, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later. But it is very cool to say that I made it, from Registered Nurse to Software Engineer. I&#39;m sure you want to hear the salary as well, it was always annoying to see people who got jobs but never listed their salary, it would be incredibly helpful if they did. For me, I am starting out at around 70k. If your in a big tech city such as San Francisco you will easily be over 100k but remember cost of living there is insane. For an entry level position I am pretty happy with that salary, within a couple years it could easily jump to 150+, but ultimately I just want to learn and grow more with a great work-life balance, so money is secondary to me. Final words, in case you were wondering if these reviews are fake or App Academy paid me to do this, they did not. That was another fear I had when searching, was that so many bootcamps had such great reviews lol. But this is absolutely my honest review, bootcamps are not for everyone, but if you truly do want to make the switch, be prepared with enough money to last you for a year, 6 months to do the program and 6 months to find a job. I hope this aides you in your search, and absolutely keep App Academy as one of your top choices if it is not already.</p>",11/29/2022,24-Week Online Full-Time Software Engineering Program,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

Instructors were there to help us with questions and issues. Expect A LOT of information each day. I finished the program with 3 projects for my portfolio. For the job hunt, I received help with my resume, technical interviewing, and behavioral interviewing. It was pretty much up to me to be proactive and use the resources available, which were endless (pair programming sessions, mock interviews, tech practice, and others).

Also I feel more emphasis could be put into learning DS&amp;A which I feel is a big part of the interview process.

However, I feel the DS&amp;A curriculum should be either extended or be something that we have to be doing throughout the program because after Module 2 you don&#39;t really get to practice it and it&#39;s just something we have to start practicing when we start looking for a job.

I will admit that I did not realize how intense it was going to be but it was well worth my time. App Academy (a/A) really makes sure that its students know and fully understand the material. They highly encourage questions at all times and there are instructional assistants that can help you all along the way if you need it. If it were not hard, a/A would not be one of the best. I chose to attend the 24 week online full time bootcamp (despite living in the SF Bay Area) because that was the best choice for me. I do come from an engineering background and had an engineering degree with a bit of programming experience before attending a/A. This truly didn&#39;t matter as there were students that excelled with no degree and no pervious experience. This bootcamp will consume close to your entire life for the 6 month duration, be ready for it. If I were to estimate, I believe I was putting in close to 10 hour days every single day for 6 months which includes weekends. I truly believe that all the struggle and long nights were worth it. After completing the program I absolutely feel prepared to work as a software engineer. Lastly, I would like to mention an extremely important perk that a/A offers that most other boot camps do not. After graduating, each student is given a career coach to help perfect/improve all necessary assets for the job search (resume, projects, etc.) Your coach will help you strategist to get you the job you actually want and even help with salary and benefit negotiations when the time comes. All in all, I highly recommend a/A but you had to be ready to give up your life for 6 months and work your butt off for an unbelievable reward.

They warned us that throughout this bootcamp, you will live and breathe code, and they were not wrong. I clocked in over 80 hours of work every week, but this amount of effort probably wasn&#39;t necessary just to simply pass the weekly assessments. Instructional staff were all very nice, understandable, and willing to help. Definitely take advantage of the TA&#39;s and ask for help! I made the mistake of wanting to try to figure things out myself, but my time would have been saved if I just called in a TA and ask for help. MAKE SURE TO EXERCISE PENCILED IN YOUR SCHEDULE; you will be sitting all day. Make friends! Coding is more fun with a small group than with yourself. Also encourage people to work with their classmates to learn about their perspectives and their way to doing things. In regards to a/A&#39;s downsides, there were a couple typos in the curriculum. Another downside would be the transition between each module.

I had no prior knowledge in coding and did not know how to code at all. App academy&#39;s structure provides a great foundation for students who do not know how to code. Their emphasis is that they want you to learn and understand rather than go through the curriculum. They implement this by having weekly assessments, that&#39;ll determine whether the student understands the topic enough to move onto the next topic. I would suggest that if you&#39;re not ready to devote your time to study outside of the curriculum then you will not pass. You&#39;re given three deferrals and if you don&#39;t pass the third time then you&#39;re out of the program.

291166,2022.0,False,Good for those who don't know where to start,"<p>App Academy has team of instructors who give lectures on SW topics and help with projects. These instructors and the job search coaches are recent graduates from AA who are also doing their own job search. The projects were fun to work on and helped me put into practice the knowledge and skills that I was gaining from the curriculum and from working with other peers. AA makes sure you adhere to deadlines and stay on top of your projects and job search. This bootcamp is useful if you need some extra encouragement and direction in software engineering. On the curriculum: You will learn Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Active Record, JavaScript, React and Redux. There is very little on CS topics and ultimately when you finish the curriculum, they tell you to go back and study data structures and algorithms on your own and via LeetCode because that is what companies will interview you on. There is an assessment almost every week for the first 2 months and will have very thorough practice tests and some will just be a simple practice test. Instructors will tell you to do each practice test at least 10x over the weekend and the assessments are mostly memorization of material. Every night there is homework to do each night to prep you for the project you will do pair programming with the next day. The quality of this material can vary greatly from topic to topic. Post curriculum: Once you finish the 16-week curriculum, you have to do 3 projects (JavaScript, Fullstack and MERN, with MERN being a group project) which will become your portfolio projects. Once these are done, their job search team will guide you through the process of making job search materials. This will includes resume, cover letter, portfolio website, creating GitHub, LinkedIn and AngelList profiles, and how to give a personal pitch. So far I have received wonderful feedback from coaches (also past graduates). For those who are good at self study, you probably won&#39;t need AA because their curriculum is the same as their free online curriculum, or other free resources online. Communication with their team can be disorganized as they don&#39;t have a consistent platform to share information (including what is expected of each student). There were a couple things that caught us off guard and was a bit frustrating: * We were initially told passing scores for assessments are 50% but once you start, they tell you its 85% * They do not use Slack Premium, so you will not be able to look at communication that is over 1 week old * Deadlines for various tasks may be given in Zoom chats, Slack or verbally (inconsistent) - It would have been best if they used email * They have a bot that emails nightly with information needed but they are not updated - often we received deadlines for previous cohorts * All marketing says it&#39;s a 16-week program but after the 16-weeks, they begin the job search period which you are still required to attend for at least the first couple weeks after graduation, meaning you can&#39;t make vacation plans, this should have been better communicated prior to signing onto bootcamp Ultimately, it depends on what you want to get out of a bootcamp. They provide a set curriculum and structure for those who need it, which I like to have. I really enjoyed meeting people from a very diverse collection of backgrounds and learning from each of them. I also had a lot of fun using the knowledge learned to do the final projects. Since instructors are past grads, there is quite a bit of turnover and I think each cohort&#39;s experience will vary greatly depending on the team of instructors. It&#39;s a very good start for anyone who doesn&#39;t have a technical background and doesn&#39;t know how to start, or what materials to study on their own.</p>",7/27/2022,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.3,[],3.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy

The curriculum was excellent, and I think a huge part of the value is the assistance with the job search after you complete the program, for up to a year. I would recommend a/A to anyone looking for a serious web development bootcamp. It is, however, very difficult. I attended the full-time online program lasting 6 months. The majority of the students that started in my cohort were deferred (meaning you did not pass an assessment and are rolled back to the previous cohort to retake the last month&#39;s material - you get 3 deferrals and are dismissed on the 4th). The advertised 60-80 hours of work a week is no joke. The program is certainly not for everyone - you will get out of this program what you put into it. They are constantly updating the curriculum as technologies change, which can be frustrating, but this is a real-life part of being a developer. The emphasis on pair programming also turns some folks off, but once I got used to it I came to really appreciate the approach. Bottom line: If you are not planning to dedicate yourself fully to this bootcamp for 6 months, do not attend. But if you are willing to live breathe and sleep code and comp sci for 6 months to facilitate a career start or a career change, I can&#39;t think of a better option than a/A.</p>",7/12/2022,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

With how the program is set up, I feel like you actually get to learn the material with pair programming and figuring things out yourself. Going through some weeks I was very lost early in the week, but because of the structure by Thursday or Friday I felt very comfortable with the material. There were few weeks were I was stressing over the weekend because the homework and practices helped to iron out anywhere I was struggling during the week.

I took some preliminary courses on a/A open, and decided to go all in to the 24 week online program. I had no background in coding, but I was able to learn Javascript/Python, sequelize/sqlalchemy, react and redux, and much more. I was able to get great team building experiences and make 2 projects. I also got the chance to showcase my individual ability with 2 solo projects. App academy instructors are caring and very helpful. They also offer great coaching and guidance to graduates in order to help them land a job. My biggest advice for anyone looking to join is to be seriously prepare to give up your free time, and be open to studying in groups. A lot of people I know that didn&rsquo;t want to put the games/partying down didn&rsquo;t make it through the program.

However, App Academy&#39;s friendly instructors and my fellow cohort mates made the physical isolation feel like nothing as I would log in every day looking forward to talking and learning to code with them. The course, while challenging (I put in 70-80 hours a week), was fair and the material was taught in a clear, step-wise manner that allowed for ideas to reinforce each other day after day.

My career coach gave me wonderful and insightful advice to clean up job application materials as well as how to properly prepare for interviews. That advice resulted in me being offer three software engineering jobs within 2 months of graduating with one being well over 120k a year. The cons of App Academy are two fold 1) the cost as compared to other boot camps with deferred payment tuition plans, such as Hack Reactor, and 2) during the program, sometimes the daily emails would contradict what was said in lecture.

If you are unable to fully commit to it, don&rsquo;t bother because most likely they will kick you out - there&rsquo;s an assessment almost every week and if failed more than two, you are out! By the 4th week of my cohort, half of the cohort mates were gone. At the end of the 16th week, only one-third of cohort mates were able to make it to graduation. We had an instructor and 3 instructor assistants. They were knowledgeable about the learning materials and were able to explain very well whenever we had questions. In order to graduate, we had to have three projects - a javascript, full-stack, and team-collaboration full-stack project. These are keys to landing a job, especially if you had no prior experience in the software engineering field. I am glad they had this as part of their curriculum! After graduation, technical and behavior coaches did a fantastic job preparing me for the interview process. In the 3rd week of the job-hunting process, I had more interviews scheduled than I could handle so I had to slow down my application submission. I got two offers by the end of the 4th week and accepted one. Now working as a Software Engineer in a public traded company and loving it!

I am currently in the sprint week, so I do not have any opinion on the job support yet, but so far the leads for jobs are good, the workshops available seem helpful as well.

I was working at a dead-end job as a landscaper, and couldn&rsquo;t afford to move out of my parents house. I dropped out of college because it was two expensive and didn&rsquo;t really have any other plan. I knew a few people who attended App Academy and decided to pull the trigger and quit both my jobs. I did the JavaScript Bootcamp prep which was kind of expensive but I did think that it gave me a head start on learning JavaScript. Although, in hindsight, there are many online resources that would&rsquo;ve made a great alternative as well! I did the 16-week Ruby immerse program and it was tough. Very tough. I for-sure had a few mental breakdowns about passing exams but looking back, there is nothing they teach that it too complicated to learn, it&rsquo;s just a lot in a short amount of time. You need to know how to pace yourself so you don&rsquo;t burn out and I recommend getting as far ahead in App Academy Open before starting the official course. And do the homework! It is very important! After the 16 weeks, I was able to get a fully remote frontend developer role paying 90k+ one week after graduating.

It is very important to know that: Do not expect anyone will hold your hand and feed you all the knowledge, the point here is to learn HOW TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN.

Pros: - Really good instructors (at least for my cohort - Darren/Spencer/Diego were amazing teachers) - Short timeframe to gain the necessary skills/experience - Good project experience to fill out resume and give real world examples of programming - Got a lot of pair programming experience - Good partnership opportunities with certain companies (including some FAANG level opportunities) - Strong sense of community with your cohort Cons: - Some of the curriculum is a little outdated (specifically the React portion could be better). You should 100% learn React hooks after the cohort ends to be ready for frontend interviews (or even before if you feel ambitious). - Homework/instructional videos start out quite good and get to be lower quality towards the end of the course - Advanced data structures and algorithms are mostly just touched upon briefly and not covered in depth, so you&#39;ll need to learn them on your own - JavaScript is the language you&#39;ll feel strongest in by the end of the program, and it&#39;s not ideal to interview in. Ruby is also taught but you won&#39;t be using it too actively post week 8 aside from the full stack project, but a lot of companies do not interview in Ruby - After the instruction ends, there are a lot of boilerplate meetings you&#39;ll need to go to for the career quest which will slow down your study of data structures and algorithms.

Cons - Very steep learning curve at first - about 65% of our cohort made it to the end.

I remember&nbsp;I used to struggle with loops and variables when I started the Bootcamp, but in the end, I was able to create a full-stack single-page web application. App Academy&#39;s&nbsp;course structure&nbsp;is perfect, it starts with basics and ramp-up&nbsp;to an advanced&nbsp;level.

After 2 weeks, there are&nbsp;lectures&nbsp;in the morning and pair boarding in the afternoon.I really enjoyed pair boarding, it does improve your social skills and prepare you for the work environment and job interviews, plus you get to learn a lot from your fellow students. I had an amazing team of TAs, they were always ready to help and teach new things. They are also app academy&nbsp;graduates, so&nbsp;you get to learn a lot from their experiences.

The program itself wasn&#39;t extremely difficult for me, but I had lots of friends to ask for help and prior exposure. My biggest takeaway from the bootcamp was that you get out of it what you put in. There were students that dedicated 6 months to learning as much as they could and it showed by the time we presented our capstone projects. I would be hesitant to recommend this program to anyone without prior knowledge or experience with programming. You are making a massive financial commitment and quite frankly this career isn&#39;t for everyone. I think App Academy is a great investment if you know you&#39;re capable and want to break into the tech industry.

I am honestly shocked at how much I&#39;ve learned in just 24 short weeks. I went from knowing ZERO code to being able to confidently create a functioning full stack web application. You definitely need to be self motivated and put the hours in, but the way they have structured their curriculum is really beneficial to learning and understanding the languages they teach (currently JavaScript and Python). My issue with learning how to code on my own was always getting stuck and not knowing how to get unstuck. App Academy&#39;s instructors and TA&#39;s are invaluable assets to the coding experience, not to mention the growth that comes with pair programming with another person and having to explain your code out loud. It&#39;s definitely not a flawless system, and they have a couple bugs to iron out on their curriculum at times, but I&#39;m really thankful for my experience at App Academy.

286881,2021.0,False,Would Recommend,"<p>App Academy was a great experience. I attended the 16-week program online due to the pandemic. The first 2 weeks of the course is independent self study of Ruby basics with the AA curriculum. TAs are available for questions if you ever encounter a concept you don&#39;t understand. After the first 2 weeks, a normal day starts with a lecture in the morning and pair boarding in the afternoon. The evenings will consist of homework assignments to prepare for the next day&#39;s material. While it isn&#39;t always mandatory to complete all the assignments, it does help you get ready for the next day. Be prepared to spend over 90-100 hours a week learning. Since the program is so fast paced, if you fall behind it&#39;s very difficult to catch up. Some of the AA material online is out of date from what&rsquo;s being currently used. For example the curriculum teaches how to use the old React Router syntax instead of the newest one. Overall it does teach you the core concepts of many different technologies in a short amount of time. I think the experience does highly depend on what TAs you get and how much of a self learned you are. The TAs I had were great and really spent the time to go over the material and answer questions. After finishing the bootcamp, App Academy assigns you a coach to help you with your job search. There are also many workshops and resources they have that really do help with the job search. The support they give you after graduating is one of the reasons I chose to go to AA. The system that have keeps you accountable and motivated during your job search. If you are someone who wants a more guided and structured approach to learning coding, AA is a great choice.</p>",3/17/2022,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
286777,2021.0,False,Hard work but it paid off,"<p>App Academy was 6 months of intense study in full-stack web development. I did the online 24 week program and my background was in electrical engineering beforehand but there were plenty of good developers in my cohort who were not from a technical background. The best part of app academy is having the group of people all studying together trying to pick up new skills quickly. We pair programmed for 4 to 6 hours per day and worked on solo and group projects. The really big advantage of doing app academy over self-study is that you have TAs there live with you and you can ask questions and get help on the spot. The program was lot of work, I would say that it is about the equivalent of working a full-time job and then taking classes in the evening. You are online for the length of a full-time job and then you have a few hours of homework every night. Our cohort started with about 85 people and i think only about 20 or 25 of us made it all the way through so it is definitely difficult. The other really nice thing about app academy is the partnership companies.

I had a great team of instructors and TAs who were patient, knowledgeable, and understood the struggles I was going through. The learning styling during some of the curriculum changed during my time at a/A to the flipped classroom style, which was tough to adjust to, but I eventually saw the benefits of the struggle of problem solving first before lecture. Though at times it was frustrating, I feel like it made me a better problem solver and a stronger developer.

If you do that and work hard, you will be in good hands by the end of the program. The curriculum does get increasingly difficult, as with everything you learn in life, but there is great support and the instructors are always available to answer any questions you may have to clarify specific things.

I will not lie, it is a lot of work (60-80 hours a week). While I was attending, we learned Python, Javascript, React, and many more of the most used technologies in the industry. They are constantly updating the curriculum, so you are always learning the most up-to-date technologies and practices. There are weekly assessments for the majority of the course, so be prepared to study quite a bit. Along with the great curriculum, you get access to amazing instructors and TA&#39;s to answer any questions you may have. During the 24 week program, we built 4 full-stack projects (2 group projects and 2 solo projects) that we are able to gain experience from and to put on our resume.

285207,2021.0,False,Incredible program -- but you need to be extremely self-motivated,"<p>I did App Academy&#39;s 16-week program and got a job that pays $110k within a few weeks of graduating. What more do you need to know? In all seriousness, this program is legit. I consider myself a strong learner with a good work ethic, but a/A pushed me further than I would ever have been able to go on my own. Personally, I think the high pressure of App Academy alone is worth the price. Do some back-of-the-envelope math for yourself, but, for me, the opportunity to get a job as a software engineer 4-5 months faster than it would&#39;ve taken me if I were self-teaching (just a guess; it might&#39;ve taken much longer) was easily worth more money than the cost of tuition. But the bootcamp isn&#39;t just about &quot;structure and accountability&quot;, which is what people usually talk about when they&#39;re explaining why they did a bootcamp. The team project was extremely helpful when I was interviewing, and the job search support is A+, too. (Again, they push you to do far more than you probably would do on your own, like applying to 40 jobs in your first week on the market. They can also connect you to &quot;partner&quot; employers, though YMMV.) Are there downsides? You bet! The time commitment is extreme. I gave up my social life for 4 months (plus a month of job-hunting). By the end, I was pretty ragged and feeling overworked. Also, the lectures in the morning were sometimes pretty awful, since many of the instructors are not great teachers and are reading from someone else&#39;s lecture notes. In their defense, most university-level teaching is awful, too, so it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to find a better alternative. The upshot is that you need to be extremely self-motivated: Hit every target they give you, and compensate for any weaknesses in the curriculum/teaching by doing your own research. Is the lecture confusing or the assignment vague? Ask for help, scour the internet for other resources, and don&#39;t settle for being confused. One more thing: Make sure you&#39;re ready. A number of students in my cohort didn&#39;t finish the program. As part of applying to a/A you need to complete their introductory curriculum, but I would recommend doing additional work (e.g. at least a few weeks of CS50x) just to make sure you really love this stuff enough to do it even when it&#39;s exhausting/difficult. Don&#39;t quit your job until you&#39;re sure you can take whatever a/A throws at you (and more)! In sum, though, I loved App Academy, and there&#39;s no way I would be where I am today without their guidance and support!

There are some pros and cons here and there though: Pros- - Super supportive staff who really just want to see you succeed and make the bootcamp feel less pressuring - You get to meet a ton of new people here who are relatively in the same position as you or have the same interest - Instructors are also super lenient as long as you&#39;re forthcoming with your circumstances. While there are specific check-in times, if you&#39;ve experienced an accident and don&#39;t have the time to, as long as you let them know ASAP they&#39;re really understanding about your situations. Cons- - There is a lot of content on the platform that needs to be updated/changed. Some of the modules we skipped over projects because they didn&#39;t want us doing them or typos in the curriculum</p>",10/21/2021,App Academy Open,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

I put in a lot of extra hours and a lot of effort to keep up with everything. If you learn quickly and do well teaching yourself then this is the course for you. There were times later in the program where help from instructors was a little lacking, not only did it seem that they didn&#39;t have all the answers but that they didn&#39;t have the time to help either. It is a fast paced program so I think the problem lies in the fact that we are hungry and plentiful and there just isn&#39;t enough time for it all to be possible. I would definitely recommend the program, just make sure you make friends and get a group of supporters together during the bootcamp.</p>",10/5/2021,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

281873,2021.0,False,Learn everything they DIDN'T teach in college.,"<p>I graduated last year with a CS degree, but knew absolutely nothing about actual engineering work. The first 3 weeks at a/A gave me more practical skills than my entire degree, and within a few months of graduation I was getting contacted by companies that I had never even applied to, including at least one FAANG company. What made the difference on my resume is not that I had a/A listed, but that I had actual projects with links to live websites and bullets talking about the technical details of what I worked on. That&#39;s honestly the biggest strength in this (or any) coding bootcamp. Yes, I learned a ton from the instructors, the lectures, the curriculum, and even from my classmates. But what I needed to land a job was real experience working on real projects using the technologies that companies are looking for. Whether or not you have any prior coding experience, you WILL come out of this bootcamp with at least 3 projects that you can call your own and discuss in-depth with potential employees. There&#39;s nothing more exciting than reading at a job description a week after graduation and realizing, &quot;Wow, I know how to do all of that.&quot; My perspective is definitely skewed by the fact that I had a CS degree coming in. However, I can assure you that by the time we got to week 3, we were learning things way beyond what I was taught in college. And yet there were plenty of students around me with no coding background at all who were doing as good or better than I was. It&#39;s a very tough course. Expect that you will have to pour every ounce of yourself into it for 4 months straight, with the constant fear of failure hanging over your head. Make sure you are mentally (and physically) ready to handle that.

The bootcamp is designed to teach you from the ground up, so prior coding experience is not needed. However, this also means that the bootcamp will focus on breadth instead of depth of material and topics covered. The goal is to provide you with the bare minimum required to qualify for entry level positions. Actual job search success depends on individual effort, but there is continued support until you do so.

The instructional staff for the most part was top-notch, though near the end of the course a few instructors gave the impression they would rather be anywhere but there. By and large, though, the staff were always friendly and helpful and would usually go out of their way to find resources to further explain some of the harder concepts. The curriculum itself is intense and does not stop. There were little if any opportunities to not give it 100% throughout the 24-week online course. The use of spaced repetition throughout the course would often give glimmers of hope as I would somehow be able to recall and apply a concept that absolutely baffled me a few weeks earlier. Coming out of the course I am quite confident in my abilities as a software developer. If you&#39;re looking to kickstart your career and are driven to succeed I would consider this program.

The supportive staff went over JavaScript, Python, Express, React and Redux with expert detail and was able to answer our troubleshooting concerns. While I attended just hoping to learn to code, I came away with a lot more than that. The continued education available through the program is valuable for maintaining a programmatic vocabulary. While the program is tough, there&#39;s so much happening each day that time flies and I walked away with a grip of friends, valuable skills, and now I can make cool apps that help me every day. I thought I was a lost cause for today&#39;s economy having been through so many odd jobs started to feel like settling with a job with decent pay.

It is easier if you&#39;ve had previous experience or a degree in CS, as many of my fellow students did, but I had to spend literally all my waking hours in front of the computer to keep up. That said, if you put in the work, you should be able to keep up. The TAs and most instructors are previously graduated students, they&#39;ve been through the program themselves and know what it feels like, so they are very helpful and nice. Less than 20% of the class of graduates made it through without any deferrals, and of the original amount of students, there was only about 25% left when graduating, so if you do not have the time and energy to fully dedicate yourself to the program, it may not be the best choice for you...

279870,2021.0,False,Great if you know what you're getting into in advance,"<p>The good: The curriculum is updated regularly. Most of the staff is extremely friendly and tries to be helpful. You can develop great friendships and network very easily with fellow students. There are plenty of fun projects to work on and some extra curriculum you&#39;ll have access to when you want it. The bad: They don&#39;t necessarily handle those updates to the curriculum well, which creates a really inconsistent experience for students across different cohorts. This would be manageable on its own - the world of SWE is constantly changing and that&#39;s a good expectation to have coming in. However, a/A&#39;s communication - both internally and to the students - is definitely not what it could be. Rapid changes leave the staff uncertain, which means communication to students is poor and transparency is often highly lacking. The laughable: The Progress Tracker is a super silly solution to a mundane regulatory issue. Take screenshots of your check-ins in case you need to &#39;prove&#39; you pressed the button because it&#39;s not always a reliable tool. The questionable: Many of the people who will teach you have recently graduated from the program themselves. This is typical of boot camps, but I had cohort-mates whose confidence in the program was shaken by the fact that we were being taught by people who just finished class rather than by experts. When they assist, TAs are often looking back at their own solutions and aren&#39;t as able to answer questions thoughtfully vs. regurgitating what they were taught, which may or may not apply to your question. There are many standouts, though - find them, befriend them, and learn everything they have to offer. The takeaway: The most important thing you can learn at App Academy is how to survive the constant barrage of information. When I went through, there were assessments most weeks of the online program. To survive those and remain in the class, you had to be able to chug from the firehouse constantly and then turn that knowledge around into practical application immediately. Because of this, what you&#39;re really doing is learning how to learn - and that&#39;s arguably more important than coming out a perfectly brilliant engineer. If you make it through, you&#39;ll be able to do the same on the job - learn quickly and efficiently and turn that knowledge around into practical application immediately.

One caveat, it would be unfit for me to say that this quick success is not a part of my previous experience mixed in with the App academy curriculum. Many DO struggle to find jobs and the AVERAGE timeframe for a job after graduation is about 6 months, those 6 months being filled with meticulous job search and application searching. I had the privilege to be scoped by recruiters thanks to my previous experience and new skills.

My cohort was the last one, as I understand it, to learn Ruby which in the job market has been largely replaced by a high demand in Python. Even still App Academy gave taught me the fundamentals of backend engineering to be able to look at backend code in other languages and hold my own; but buyer beware because this was largely due to my own learning post graduation. That is the main point I want to make, the program is intense from the get go and they will teach you (and they admit to this) 80% of what you need to know to get a job as a software engineer but the other 20% comes from the work and dedication that you put in post graduation. Some of the course material will seem uneven and feel like you spend the most time on the things that won&#39;t be the most important to finding a job, but App Academy is there to also teach you how to continue to learn to code over the course of your whole career. I learned a lot over my time at App Academy, it was intense, I met and made amazing friends in my program and ultimately got a great job as a software engineer.

279180,2021.0,False,"Above and Beyond Program, Ineffective Current Communication Tools, Difficult for Parents","<p>I know there are a lot of reviews here that speak to the curriculum, work, hours needed, and tools used by App Academy to teach their curriculum. In a nutshell... The program is amazing. The work is hard. There is never enough time. You&rsquo;ll meet amazing people and build an awesome network. The TAs are what you are really paying for and are great. The intent behind their propriety tools (that are a WIP) can be clearly seen and it&rsquo;s got a bright future. The online course is best for individuals that have other responsibilities and being in person has the added value of others being in the room to help motivate you to get the work done. The only thing I will harp on is that their current communication tools used for peer and TA chats are in rough shape. The folks who started the program didn&rsquo;t know how big it would get and initially invested in Slack&hellip; which if you ask any current employee at a/A is the bane of their App Academy existence. Because a/A leaves their Slack channel open to Alumni (great intent!), the amount of users has grown to a point where it wouldn&rsquo;t make financial sense to pay monthly per user (didn&rsquo;t think about scale from the get go). From a business perspective, I agree that it would be a poor decision to pay monthly and it&rsquo;s a band aid solution for now&hellip; but from a student perspective this was one of the biggest resource failures in the course as I have no history of chats from TAs or colleagues from as little as just 3 days ago. I understand the current situation and I also implore App Academy to find a more permanent solution ASAP. Having gone through the course and used many different comm tools in my career&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you how many question threads were posted in Slack&hellip; and if it&rsquo;s one thing slack is terrible at it&rsquo;s threading conversations. All that being said&hellip; I&rsquo;ll focus on the Parent perspective below. Firstly&hellip; parents take the one online course. It the only option that gives you the flexibility to be with your family if an emergency arises. I&rsquo;ll also say that if you are a single parent with 100% physical custody and don&rsquo;t have support to help watch your children&hellip; this program is probably not for you. Emphasis on &lsquo;single parent&rsquo; and the requirements needed to be the superhuman you already are. There is a high probability that you will fail out of the program or stretch yourself too thin to be able to take care of, let alone spend time with your kid(s). IMO you will NEED support from your partner/support network for childcare. In fact, I&rsquo;d start budgeting for the best &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; gift you can think of before you even start the program. The balance is critical and allows for you to complete the program and spend quality time with your kids. If you have a partner in house to help&hellip; I&rsquo;d be very clear about setting the expectation that they will become the primary caregiver, with you seeing your kids for meals and weekends. Did I mention you&rsquo;re going to have to REALLY say thank you to your partner for helping out as much as he/she will? If you have a joint custody agreement&hellip; I advise trying to switch to a schedule where you get your kids on Friday and Saturday only. Saturday is the only day of the week where NOTHING is App Academy related. On Sundays you&rsquo;ll be studying for your assessments. To end on a brighter note&hellip; I&rsquo;m proof that it could be done. I had my kiddo on Thursday Night, Friday Morning and Night, and Saturday Morning&hellip; and it was doable. Barely&hellip; but doable. In fact, I had to project defer over Spring Break (which happens to coincidentally have been my project week) so that I would be able to show up for my family. Parenting and doing this program definitely tops the list of one of the hardest things that I&rsquo;ve ever had to do. There&rsquo;s also a great a/A Parent group that&rsquo;s really helpful for support. They meet every two weeks or so. I highly suggest joining and even more so, suggest practicing to reach out to these peers because they are the only ones who can truly understand what it means to be a parent. Hope all that helps! In the end, I DO recommend App Academy. My gut says that it will only get better as they learn and time goes on.

They pass this off as a feature rather than a bug and in theory it is but not they way that they do it. The company is overly compartmentalized which seems to be intentional to give any department the ability to pass the proverbial buck onto another department. Often you find that the materials lack in the way of pedagogy. In addition many of the instructors early in the program have not been given much in the way of training to educate students. The TA&#39;s have had less training in that regard from the start of the program to the end. An additional note on the TA&#39;s in some cases the TA&#39;s you will have will have graduated only days previous. I am not saying they are not capable software developers but there is a difference between being able to write code and being able to teach a person how to write code. aA will constantly try tweaking things to create &quot;improvements&quot; these improvements are often in good spirit but poorly thought out. Changes are not relayed from department to department, Instructors and TA&#39;s have not familiarized themselves with the new curriculum or the implementation of the improvement is just for lack of a way of saying it bad. This is normal when changes happen in a company, growing pains will happen of course. The problem with that is you as a student are only going to go through a portion of the program once or face deferral. If the portion of the program you are going through has had changes made to it for your iteration the mistakes made by the program are blamed on you and you face the consequences. Now those are the negative portions of aA. These are the positives, The staff in most cases care greatly for the students there are some exceptions to that through. The program will teach you how to write code. I started with absolutely no coding experience and made it through the program and feel comfortable calling myself a software developer. The program is great for a person who may not have the discipline to teach themselves. You will make deep and real friendships in the program. Words of advice to students considering aA. Don&#39;t expect aA to read your mind, you have to communicate with the staff. Get to know your PTM and Assistant PTM. They will be your rock through the program. Do not be afraid to give them real feedback on the program or things going on. They really do take it with grace and do care how you are doing. It is a Marathon and not a sprint.

I was able to secure a job a little faster than my cohort mates mostly based on my previous job experience outside of Software Development. The problems start before and after you begin your study. You&#39;re going to be told about a 90+% graduation and job placement rate. However I haven&#39;t spoken to anyone who didn&#39;t have the same experience as me of losing about 30% of their classmates during the cohort.

Be prepared to have to attend a &quot;Study Hall&quot; until your projects are finished to the school&#39;s satisfaction and/or you get a job. And you better graduate. If you don&#39;t, be prepared for an invoice of $250/day of study. Couple all of this with the high turnover of staff and you may be better off looking at another school or educating yourself.

The program is still great, but the support during job search sucks. My coach just kept telling me to apply and do algos, that is all fine and all, but you don&#39;t really get coached that well. Get this, my coach was an app academy student who wasn&#39;t able to find a job, so he became a coach. How is someone who couldn&#39;t find a job suppose to coach me on finding mine? He provided almost no support. If you saw my coaches statistics, it was like 4 people found jobs under him in 2 months. They should be transparent with how effective each coach was. My negative experience stems from the job search portion. The material otherwise was decent, they whip you into shape and that&#39;s one of the reasons why we attend this bootcamp. And they do a great job at that, but again job search portion with my coach was complete garbage. I was able to find a job within a year since beginning the program.

The first module we went through was great. Full of examples and problems, discussions on where we would see the JavaScript concepts in real life, video tutorials to supplement the lectures. I felt like I was learning loads every day. It was tough, but totally fair. I would have highly recommended the program. Then came Mod 2. Without telling us they completely changed the curriculum from what we signed up for. We now get very few examples of the concepts, and very little lecture time. When we asked if we could get more example problems we were told, I kid you not, that they are too difficult to come up with and that we should write them. One of our cohort mates came up with a set of problems that night for us. The curriculum designer has been rude and dismissive of our concerns. We have asked for an updated syllabus and have been told they don&#39;t know what they are going to put after this module. We have asked to talk to a representative from App Academy and haven&#39;t gotten it. We asked for access to the old curriculum so that we could at least see what they were doing before and were told explicitly that we could not see the old curriculum. They keep telling us that they want us to struggle and figure it out. There are some possibly cool projects in Module 2, but we can&#39;t enjoy them because we aren&#39;t being given the tools to understand them in the first place. I did not pay this kind of money to struggle to find materials for myself outside of class. I paid this kind of money to streamline the material so I could struggle to become a great software developer! Avoid App Academy until further notice.

You will make many great friends in the cohort along the way that will help you have a good initial base network that you will carry with you into your career, and the career coaches and an abundance of additional resources will be there for you in the job search(which I am in right now). Keep in mind the onus will mostly be on you throughout the program to pass the assessments, get your projects done, and get the new career you are dreaming of. The instructors and coaches will help you, but you will also need to help yourself to be in the top applicants in a competitive market. I would say the main con is there is a lot of information thrown at you and a lot of times it can be disorganized, so you need to ask lots of questions and figure out what is important either for your short term understanding of the technologies or what companies are expecting you to know in the real world.</p>",5/11/2021,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

The &quot;structure&quot; of the course (If you can even call it that) is a highly technical lecture for 3-4 hours and then free time to work on problems while asking sullen and underinformed TAs for help. For this, App Academy demands $30k and will charge you about $160/day. This works out to almost $40/hour to have an unmotivated &quot;instructor&quot; who can&#39;t get a job as a developer push information at you for 3-4 hours a day. This is what they call &quot;teaching&quot; -- a criminal use of the word. If you can&#39;t keep up with the too-fast pace, unhelpful TAs, and unmotivated instructors who have no idea how to teach, you&#39;ll be kicked out of the course for a month to be &quot;deferred&quot; to the next cohort. No help or extra instruction whatsoever is given. You are just dropped, floundering, and App Academy washes their hands of you until you repeat with a group of fresh-faced fools with big dreams of high salaries. If you defer 3 times, App Academy kicks you out for their own lack of instruction and you are immediately forced to pay thousands of dollars for the sub-par &quot;learning&quot; you never managed to do. App Academy will happily blame you, the student, and maintain the party line that it is YOUR fault they can&#39;t teach while going after you for money.

I felt like App Academy offered the best product and decided to apply for the online 6-month coding bootcamp. After finishing, I don&#39;t have any regrets :) The curriculum is thorough and the teachers/staff are professional and competent. The facts that they have an income share agreement, have been around for years, and are still growing are testaments to the effectiveness of their program. I feel confident in my abilities to code and to get a good job. Good luck in your decision process!</p>",3/31/2021,Software Engineer Track: Online,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
275357,2021.0,False,Challenging but totally doable!,"<p>I did not know what to expect when I decided to make a change and sign up for a bootcamp. I have always been into computers and tech but never thought about programming. I did a lot of looking at different bootcamps and I wanted to be sure I was getting the most out of my experience. I decided to go for a longer bootcamp which would encompass more material and chose the 24 week program at App Academy. The hours are long and you really need to learn how to learn again. There was a big adjustment and there is the added pressure of not just learning new material but being able to solve problems based on what you learned on Monday for an assessment. If you do not score an 80% you will be deferred back a month. That was a lot of added stress on myself and classmates I would talk to. The staff for the most part is pretty friendly and helpful and want to help you succeed. One thing to note is that when you finish the course and move into the career hunt phase, you can still receive strikes for not completing things. If you do strike out during the career hunt you lose all access to the material that you paid for on the site which I do not agree with. Overall the curriculum is fast pace and constantly evolving. The projects are fun and the pair work actually brings some getting to know classmates into the online program. Be prepared to be challenged and put in a lot of hours!</p>",3/31/2021,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
275347,2021.0,False,Ultimately Worth It,"<p>The saying that you&#39;ll get out of it what you put into it applies 100% here. App Academy uses a deferral system to measure mastery of material. That is, almost every Monday you are assessed on the previous week&#39;s material and need an 80% to pass. If you cannot pass, you are deferred into the cohort that started a month after you; ideally so you have time to review the material up to that point, and so you redo the week where you could not pass the assessment. While I was never deferred it is common for folks to defer, and it is common for folks to consistently barely survive each assessment. If you are prone to crack under pressure, these assessments can be intimidating; but App Academy gives you more than enough practice and resources over the weekend to ace every assessment. At times the projects used to teach the curriculum have frustrating or vague instructions. The canned response is that you as a developer have to be able to figure things out on your own, which while true to some degree feels like an excuse for the student:faculty ratio that&#39;s been affected by the boom in class size due to COVID and the course&#39;s popularity. Where you are really getting your money&#39;s worth is in the Job Search support. The post-grad system becomes your accountability partner, and the networking opportunity is great. Ultimately though, you are the one that has to take initiative and reach out. Overall, if I had to do this all over again, I would join an accelerated bootcamp that has a more rigorous technical assessment. If you think you&#39;ll thrive in a slower/more drawn-out pace with the 6-month online, then this will be a good fit for you.</p>",3/31/2021,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.0,[],4.0,3.0,5.0,app-academy

I went through the 24 week online course and I have to say that it is an intense process that challenges you week in and week out. Some say it&#39;s the hardest thing that they have ever done and I can&#39;t say that I disagree. I can say that the grueling nature of it has a purpose and you emerge all the better for it. It is not for everyone, some find the steep learning curve too hard but if you are committed and you put in the necessary time, it is very doable and worthwhile. The overall highlight is definitely the staff, who mostly support you throughout the whole course and continue the support into your job search. The curriculum material can be a little erratic in its teaching format and does occasionally need some updating, but you do learn the most current and up to date coding styles.</p>",3/31/2021,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
274794,2020.0,False,You Can Do This!,"<p>This program is a serious undertaking, but the results are worth it! When they say 90+ hours a week, they&#39;re not kidding. I had a prior CS degree and still found some of the course content quite challenging. But do not let that deter you! I was constantly impressed by how much my cohort-mates who had &lt; 1 year of coding experience were able to pick up. This experience is truly what you make of it, and I promise you can do it. I originally thought I could study all of this material on my own, but I don&#39;t think I could have done it nearly as effectively and quickly. Almost 3 months since graduation, I have already landed a solid job offer and have seen several people in my cohort-mates doing the same. If you work diligently and truly take advantage of the resources a/A provides for you, you really can change/advance your career. Here are some of my overall pros and cons for the program: Pros: - Even remote (due to COVID), help was easily accessible from our TA&#39;s through most of the process, and our cohort was so supportive of one another. - While the assessments can be daunting and can determine your fate in the course, the TA&#39;s hold office hours leading up to them that are extremely helpful and, I think, important for your success. - Paired programming forces you to learn how to communicate your code and thought processes to others (a skill that is so important in interviews and of course in the field). - You will graduate with 3 major projects that demonstrate your skills. a/A understands that you want them to be your best and although there are &quot;deadlines&quot;, you will be able to continue working on them before you are required to start looking for jobs. Cons: - I did feel that the HTML/CSS curriculum is not taught in lectures enough. It is mostly in self-taught lessons. Without a firm understanding of this material, starting/styling your major projects can be really overwhelming. - The daily projects that you and your partner do are structured to be very difficult and time consuming (you will likely never finish everything). Depending on your pace and understanding, you may not make it far enough to receive the practical experience on everything that was taught that day. - Many of the people who are part of the job search curriculum are really great at what they do, but it is truly on you to be proactive and take advantage of everything they have to offer, or you may feel very much on your own.</p>",3/16/2021,,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

With that being said, it is very rigorous (9 hours of lecture &amp; projects each day), so only take on the challenge if you are truly driven to change your career. Pros: Lots of very bright, motivated students. Instructional staff is great for the most part, and they largely hire alumni so any staff member is likely to have gone through a/A as well. Cons: Some of the curriculum materials could be revamped as they are difficult to understand. There are some modules that are very easy to understand, and some material that is presented in a complicated manner. This statement is purely an opinion and does not extend to ALL a/A material, but it does apply to some. To the instructors&#39; credit, they acknowledge a lot of this feedback.

274268,2020.0,False,Restaurant Server turned Software Developer,"<p>TLDR: Of course it&#39;s hard. But the payoff is greaaaaaat! :D If you&#39;re thinking of what bootcamp, just apply to App Academy. Pros: - Amazing experience - You can ask for help aaaaaaaaaall the time - Lots of resources - Relevant course materials - Software salaries are QUITE high - You learn 2 languages, a frontend framework, 3 projects (2 solo, 1 group), and a bunch of other stuff Cons: - Sooooooooooo much work (your routine will be: Coffee, Lecture, Lunch, Work, Work, Dinner, Work, Sleep, Repeat for 16-weeks) Not TLDR: Hello World! - the beginning of your journey; if in fact you are new to this stuff like I was. Before App Academy, I had been a Host and a Server in the restaurant business for four years. When the pandemic hit I was out of a job and had to look for options. I live in San Francisco and a ton of people here are in tech and so I thought I&#39;d check it out and see if it was for me. I took a two-week Jumpstart program with App Academy and there I learned Ruby - a cool language that flows like plain English; mostly. I was never great at math but have always been interested in languages. Learning to code is like learning a language. If you like that, try it out. When you&#39;re coding you&#39;re solving problems and trying to get stuff to work. It can be very gratifying! Jumpstart was a lot of fun for me and so I applied to App Academy. On my first try I hadn&#39;t practiced my skills enough but on the second try I did great! From the first day at App Academy know that you are in for a lot of work. In the morning, I think it was ~9-12:30 for me, you will have lectures with 1-2 5-10 minute breaks in-between. In the afternoon, ~1:30-5, you will be paired up with a fellow classmate to solve a bunch of problems mostly related to your morning lectures. The lectures will be based on your previous evenings material. Expect about 4-6 hours of studying every evening - I wish that were a joke but you&#39;ve got a lot to learn in 16-weeks. You will do your partner and yourself the most good if you do your homework. Please, please, please, do your homework. When I graduated, it took me about 2-3 more weeks to finish up my final projects. After that you go into job search and you will continue to do tons of work so that one day, you will land an awesome job in software!! :)</p>",3/2/2021,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

Fast forward to my actual cohort, it was one of the most challenging educational experiences I had gone through. But because the instructors made things clear, were personable, and I was surrounded by other peers motivated to change theirs live, it really helped me persist. Every weekday I went to lectures, and afterwards would complete readings and homework, while studying for exams on the weekends. Doing readings before lectures was something I had never done in college, and App Academy helped me see the benefits in doing so, and I definitely reaped them as well. I say if you genuinely are curious about and have a passion for programming, your time at App Academy will be a positive and memorable one, despite its fast pace and challenging topics. The most important things I got out of App Academy were the computer science foundations, the jumpstart I needed to feel confident to learn on my own after my cohort ended, connections that I made from it, presentable projects, and how to present myself as a software engineer for the job search.

The goals of each week are clearly stated so you know what to expect. - The projects are precious hands-on experience that will help you have a full picture of what software engineering is, especially the MERN group project where you have a lot of freedom and needed to collaborate with classmates. Cons: - Class sizes varied and a/A claims to maintain a TA to student ratio of 1:9 - 1:10. However, in the later weeks, it took a long time for a TA to come and questions were left unanswered at the end of the day. (We were encouraged to not attempt unfinished projects after lesson time.) - TAs come and go throughout the bootcamp.

273889,2020.0,False,Great Start to Your Programming Career,"<p>After attending App Academy, I can truly say the experience was something else. App Academy is a fast paced bootcamp that teaches you several technologies and languages. Some pros and cons will be listed below Pros: The structure of the entire course is well put together. I believe they did an excellent job teaching Ruby, a language that reads almost like English, in order to allow students to transition into a programming mindset. Pair programming everyday allowed students to gain experience elaborating their thoughts and putting it to words. The final projects were the best idea enabling students to put in more work than before and learning how to program themselves without the extensive help of TA&#39;s. Cons: The tests are a bit too easy. There is a clear distinction between the level of students towards the end of the course. The tests become repetitive and actually mirror some practice tests. By mirroring practice tests, students begin to memorize these not furthering their skill set. Python should be taught instead of Ruby. Ruby is great for new people entering the world of programming but Python is similar to Ruby and is used more throughout the industry. I know it&#39;s hard to switch curriculums and is very time consuming but it would be beneficial to students.</p>",2/19/2021,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy

Your projects and what you learn while building them will be more important than the fundamentals that they teach during the curriculum. Learning how to teach yourself and correctly identifying errors and bugs something you will learn App Academy and will be something that will be important in your professional career. Overall the App Academy curriculum is great and there are instructors who are there every step of the way. Once you finish the program, the training wheels fall off and you have to keep yourself regimented to keep learning &amp; coding.</p>",2/19/2021,,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

272057,2020.0,False,I tripled my salary,"<p>This review is a bit about App Academy, but it is also about my personal experience there. There are plenty of reviews talking about App Academy specifically and all the different things that make it great, but I think getting another data point on what my experience was can hopefully give you some sense on how you will be able to handle a bootcamp. (For the record, App Academy is amazing, the teachers are awesome, the documentation is &#39;mostly&#39; great, and I tripled my salary after a month of job seeking) Prior to joining App Academy, I was about a year out of college and was working as a software engineer recruiter. In college I graduated with a degree in Economics and took several computer science classes out of genuine interest. I soon began to realize that several months into my recruiting job that I did not like the work, but was still interested in software engineering. I did a lot of research and decided App Academy was the best bootcamp and I would strive to get in. I completed a web development udemy course as prep and a refresher, then applied, interviewed, and was accepted. The class was technically the in-person New York software engineer track but it was online due to Covid. I had some experience with software engineering and it&#39;s principals prior to App Academy, so the first few weeks of the course were nothing more than further review of things I had learned, but in a different language, Ruby (I believe courses now will use Python instead). Every day you have a lecture in the morning followed by projects to complete with a partner by pair programming. This is a good way to learn if you are both on the same level of understanding about the current subject, but can be frustrating when that is not the case. In the first two weeks of the course you have two exams, if you fail one of them you are suspended until the next cohort to study up and get a better understanding of the basics. If you cannot pass these exams or struggle to, you will not make it to the end. After those two weeks, you are allowed to fail two assignments. The first one you fail you do not have to retake, however, the second one you fail you must retake it later than day. If you fail it once again, you will be asked to leave the cohort, and you are not able to join another. I thought it is important to include that to know what you are getting into, it can be very stressful for some people, so please to your own studying and prep before you decide to do this course because it is extremely fast paced. Fully understanding all the material if you are learning it for the first time is unlikely. By the end of the course we had about 40 of our original clas size of 60 that graduated. After you graduate you are pretty much on your own, they give you a career coach but they are dealing with so many job seekers that they have minimal time for you per week (maybe 1-2 hours). I graduated on October 23rd and instantly began polishing up my final projects, resume, linkedin and other job seeking sites. After I was happy with how I was presenting myself, I went hard at Leetcode and did a dozen or two problems a day, making sure I was understanding them, and hitting a variety of subjects. By the end of my search I was capable of doing all easy problems and most medium level problems. While doing leetcode problems I would apply to jobs mostly on linkedin and google jobs. Technically, you are supposed to wait to apply to jobs until your career coach gives you the OK, but i went ahead and started applying anyways because it takes so long to get feedback from them. About 2 weeks into my job search I han&#39;t recieved anything back from any companies until I got a take home interview question from Draftkings. I was able to complete that (it was about OOP and building a companies organizational chart, so DFS was involved). I had a HR call the week after, and the week after than I had a virtual onsite (more OOP questions, working with json-like objects, talking about my projects, and whiteboarding (design a messaging app). I thought it all went really well, and a week later I was given an offer, which I accepted since I had NOTHING else in my pipeline. I felt I was pretty lucky to get a job only a month out of graduation, and that will certainly not happen to everyone. However, it happened to me and I pretty much tripled my salary from my last job. Bootcamps are worth it if you are able to handle the amount of information being thrown at you and you are ready to work non-stop for about 6 months with no pay (3 months at bootcamp, 3 months avg job search). Hope this helped.</p>",1/8/2021,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy
271937,2020.0,False,"You must learn how to learn to succeed, but once you've got that down, it's a rewarding experience.","<p>I started the program in July 2020, while the pandemic was in full swing, and finished it in October 2020. I felt like App Academy did a good job organizing the switch to a virtual cohort and while I still wish I had that immersive in-person experience, I think I had a good and rewarding experience overall. Pros: - The curriculum is well assembled and the projects do a great job of teaching the intended materials. I enjoyed working on daily projects a lot. - Almost every day, you pair-program with a new partner to work on a project. I liked this because it lets us practice our soft-skills which are very important in the real world. I worked with some amazing partners and we ended up having fun the majority of the time. - The instructors and TAs were helpful and were always available to point you in the right direction but never explicitly give you the answers. Cons: - Ruby was the first language taught to us in the curriculum, but they are switching to Python instead. While Ruby is a great language, I would have preferred to learn Python instead as it seems to be widely used in the industry. Alumni do have access to the Python module. - The last couple of weeks of the curriculum that lead up to the job-search part of the program felt rushed.

271904,2020.0,False,Software Engineering: Full-Time Online,"<p>Instructors are knowledgeable, helpful, responsive and always available (even in weekends if necessary). They pay attention to the needs of the class, supply an incredible amount of extra material and make a real effort to give more explanation if they see a lack of understanding. Fellow students are smart and helpful as well. I enjoyed working with them all. This is an honest and supportive learning environment. The experience with the staff handling administrative matters is also good, they do their best to help you. Since I could go straight to a job at the end of the course I have marginal experience with career coaching, but that was also impressive. During the course count on a 80-90 hour/week work, about 15 tests and four projects that need to be completed, two individually, two in groups. The projects are all very good opportunities to cement in the material. This is not an accredited institution, there is no possibility to get any benefit for the tuition in your personal income tax.

271891,2020.0,False,"Was Quite A Fulfilling Journey, But Realistic Expectations Are Needed","<p>App Academy lived up to my expectations for the most part. I knew it would be fast paced and that there would be missing spots in my learning. I am a &#39;career transitioner&#39; that had a little nest of cash stored, so I took that opportunity to move to tech. I came in with knowledge of the basics of HTML &amp; CSS from creating a Wordpress blog a few years prior and doing some FCC and Codecademy training. At the time, I was considering multiple coding bootcamps and had never even heard of a/A, but once they were on my radar, the reviews made me confident that I would be pushed to my limit, which in my head translated to becoming a very capable software engineer through intense studies. Personally, my time was solely dedicated to 32 Weeks of a/A, so if you are unable to give your entire days to them, your process will be quite trying. 10-7, take a break for dinner/family, and then a few hours of homework/study afterwards. To be transparent, I haven&#39;t found my first role yet, and I am 3 months into the job search. I have a Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s. It takes time, and the expectation given down to us is 400 - 600 applications at 25 minimum apps placed a week. I believe I&#39;m somewhere between 225 and 250 applications thus far. Please prep for this. Important Things To Note * Marketing - Take the marketing material for what it is. Yes, you can get a job making 100K in San Francisco or NY, but this is significantly harder for the online cohorts due to everyone being disbursed throughout the world. I can only speak from my experience, and my experience also tells me to let you know that you will be in the market looking for role for months if you are unwilling to move to hot spots, and many time if you are, it won&#39;t be for 100K. 100K is a lot of money if you didn&#39;t know, and companies expect a lot of those that are making the big bucks. Just frame your goals properly and know what you are signing up for. * Deferrals - I started right before Covid hit, so we were given additional opportunities to defer to later cohorts simply because of how much was going on at the time. To put it plain, once shutdowns were instated, no one was solely focused on school, family arrangements were different, and things just changed. Typically, I think you are given 3 deferrals, but 1 was added for us, making it a total of 4. I have seen people defer for medical reasons and family issues, but the most common is not passing assessments. There were around 14-15 assessments. Understand that deferrals is not a scare tactic. You will be removed from a/A and will also be required to pay a prorated amount if you end up not making it through the entire program. Read your agreements, please. For me personally, I deferred twice, making my total time in a/A 32 weeks compared to 24 weeks. That&#39;s an additional 2 months. There are weeks where 0 people defer, and then on the harder weeks, you will see double digits defer. Don&#39;t let it deter you too much. You will move to the cohort immediately behind you. There is 1 new cohort a month, so it places you 4 weeks back. On the positive side, this gives you the opportunity to reinforce concepts that didn&#39;t stick. It was well stated in my cohort(s) during our graduation that potential deferments induced more anxiety than anything else. That is where the stress lies due to you not knowing what the assessments could potentially have on them. Pressure makes diamonds, but pressure also busts pipes. * Finances - Plan accordingly. I was one who bet on myself and believed I could make it straight through without any deferrals, meaning, I chose not to do the contract and instead paid a portion up front. Well, I deferred twice. If I wouldn&#39;t have budgeted correctly, that extra two months out of work could have had long lasting implications and could have really hurt me. Be smart. * Skill Level - For the most part, a/A tests for the correct personality types in the pre-work/interview stage, but on day 1, you will soon realize that some people are just naturally gifted, have a little more experience, and there is really nothing you can do about it. They look for ambitious and driven personalities, but that isn&#39;t all that matters. Don&#39;t let this get you down. Those that are answering all of the questions and know alot more when you pair with them is great, but if you&#39;re not that person, it&#39;s not a death sentence either. We all learn in different ways and different speeds. * Technical Mentors &amp; Teaching Assistants Matter - Like college, I believe who is teaching you is equally as important as what you are learning. Speaking for myself, I didn&#39;t feel that I had the right mix of teachers until I made it into my last cohort. I felt like the mentors and ta&#39;s really fought for us when assessments were just unfair(timing or not good questions), and it genuinely felt like I had met my tribe. This has nothing to do with my previous cohorts, but honestly speaking, I didn&#39;t get that same feeling or attention. It made me regret starting when I did, meaning I came in halfway through a cohort once relationships had already been established and additionally, I had learned things in ways that were taught much better in the new cohort, etc... My cohort mates just seemed to be fundamentally stronger than I was at times, and I believe it was due to the culture that the TM and TA&#39;s created for the group. * Post Covid a/A Experience Is Different - Put simply, you&#39;re prone to be more of just a number. The pre-covid groups were small. Jan graduated ~11 , Feb graduated ~6, March graduated ~12, April graduated ~17, May graduated ~18.... Numbers ballooned severely after this. People are out of work and taking the opportunity to transition to new careers. The cohorts are now starting with 75+ students, leading them to have to change the way instruction is given as well. In my estimation, from those 75-90 students in a cohort, each graduation will now be anywhere from 30 - 40 students graduating. Just be aware that the small circles and having the little school experience is no longer there. * Students with kids under 5 - If your kids are at home during the day and you are the sole person responsible for them, I can&#39;t imagine how you will survive the curriculum. This is not extremely common, but there are some. In my case, I saw 3 different cases. Those 3 are no longer enrolled at a/A. This is not a scare tactic, but owing a company thousands of dollars is not a bright outcome, so make sure you have a daycare or someone to care for them. * Diversity - Simply put, not a ton of women and not a ton of color. For a graduation class of 17, 2 were black and 1 woman.Scholarships and marketing material(Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Instagram Ads) should be geared towards both of those communities. Slack channels for subsets of individuals is respectable and an attempt, but it&#39;s not enough. There also needs to be some diversity in the C-Suite roles. You can&#39;t understand people that you have no exposure to. * Curriculum - Pretty decent. I can only speak from the perspective that I never worked with most of the languages before doing it, so I can only compare it against FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. From that lens, it was pretty good. There were weaker sections, but I also understand how tough it is to make changes, getting approval, and everything that comes with that process. Bottom Line: Don&#39;t expect too much when you are literally learning a new subject/concept pretty much every week. A personal frustration is that a lot of the projects were centered around building a game such as Tic-Tac-Toe, King&#39;s Travail, recreating Pokedex and things like that. So, I&#39;m not a gamer, and though many coders are, it was tough at times to keep my attention. Most of us aren&#39;t going into game development, so diversifying the selection of projects should be considered. E-Commerce sites, internal banking applications, you know, things that are actively being built in the market. Just a thought. * CareerQuest/Job Support - If you are opening up an online portion, naturally I believe a global partnerships team should also be rolled out. You have students across the world, but most opportunities presented are for NY and SF. Career Coaches are doing what they can I believe and have a lot on their plates. Overall, I&#39;m still going through this process, so my entire outlook is dependent on the first role I acquire. Let it be known that the student does the work though, the coaches are just their to hold you accountable. Trust, you can also get kicked out while searching for a job as well. There are still meetings you are required to attend weekly and the pressure lessens, but doesn&#39;t stop.</p>",12/31/2020,Software Engineer Track: Online,3.0,[],3.0,3.0,3.0,app-academy
271501,2020.0,False,Challenging and Welcoming.,"App Academy is a fast paced, challenging, web development course that claims it can teach people to code with no prior experience. I attended the bootcamp in June of 2020. Here are my thoughts.

-Lots of help.
-Friendly staff.

-You pair program a lot, a necessary skill for team based tech jobs.
-The staff works extremely hard to make sure you understand the material.
-They help you find a job after graduating.
-Lots of payment plans/options for people, for example the deferred tuition.

Cons:

-Not enough coverage on data structures and algorithms.

You can make the argument that the price is worth what you get out of it. Similarly, you educations depends on you being willing to put in a lot in order to get a lot out of it. In a way you dictate the experience you have here. I enjoyed my time here. The welcoming environment was nice, and the teachers spent countless hours teaching you how to solve problems, rather than just pointing to solutions. If you genuinely want to learn and have the drive to survive the 6 month long program, you will learn a lot of information. In addition to the price the lack of data structures and algorithm teaching is in part the draw back of all boot camps, there simply is not enough time to teach you everything. They make an effort on this front however, by teaching you how to teach yourself.

271304,2020.0,False,App Academy is everything it says it is,"I did extensive research before committing to App Academy, and there are three main reasons I chose it and WOULD CHOOSE IT AGAIN:

1. a/A has an income sharing agreement, so they are intrinsically motivated to get you hired, and every piece of the program is motivated by this. In short, your goals and theirs are aligned as long as you are committed. Speaking of alignment, you really will be paired with a coach for your entire job search, and you'll have the support of your classmates, assuming you connected well with them throughout the program. In sum, a/A offers tremendous researches to aid in your search, in addition to the thorough prep in the last couple weeks of the program.

2. a/A is assessment-driven and engineering-focussed, meaning they don't carry dead weight—and more to the point, they do not have a reputation for allowing dead weight or for graduating ""web devs"" who don't really know how software works. You learn multiple languages. You learn algorithms and data structures. You build 2 solo projects and 2 group projects. It's intense. But... You are allowed up to 3 deferments. This is designed to give you the chance to have more time if you are struggling, and it also means that at a certain point, the unmotivated/less capable will be significantly challenged. That challenging is good for your skill and reputation as a potential a/A grad, so as long as you can keep up this is a plus. I found the rigor was typically held in good tension with empathetic instructors who want to support you well through what they know to be a high-paced 24 weeks.

3. People! Students I reached out to prior to choosing a/A generally had great things to say about their experience. Reach out to a/A grads on LinkedIn who live near you, and you'll likely find the same. But what makes this difference? For me, it's the people. I had the best lead instructor I could've imagined, and the TAs are generally of good quality as well. While every company likely has some instructors that fall below the curve, I really can say the instruction I received was personable, encouraging, and technically substantial. (There are some instructors that occasionally guest lectured for my cohort, and I liked them as well.) And the students? Amazing! I genuinely made a good handful of friends, and we voluntarily check in with each other as we each look for jobs. Yes, every class will have that person looking for a quick way to money, but even so they get weeded out or have a change of heart. And how can you not make friends when the average day consists of several hours pair-programming?

I've harped on about the strengths of App Academy. What are the weaknesses? I give the curriculum 3 stars—maybe 3.5 if that's allowed. But I actually really liked the curriculum, particularly the structure, pace, and topics, as well as the video instructors. a/A even updated it earlier in the year, so even recent language developments are covered. So why 3 stars? Simple: the videos are typically paired with homework in the form of article-style readings to be done the night before their topics are covered, and while many of the readings were fine, just as many were riddled with grammatical errors and unclear phrasing. Additionally, occasionally the code-along videos involved deprecation issues, leading to avoidable, class-wide encounters with bugs. While the deprecation issues are understandable, the lack of writing quality is not (aside from the classic engineering stereotypes that come to mind). 

None of these curriculum issues are reasons not to choose a/A. In fact, I bet every bootcamp faces these same challenges when it comes to keeping curriculum current and polished. These reasons do, however, provide for a point of growth on the part of App Academy, and I know they are aware of this and constantly improving, welcoming your constant feedback. You are, after all, required to provide it daily, and in my experience they take it really seriously. What makes this ultimately excusable for now is that students always have ample opportunity to ask questions on every single lecture topic, so you are always supported as you seek to master content. There wasn't a single topic for which I wasn't provided a live Q & A. Ask away!

A small but earnest point should be made before concluding. You really must take into account the length of job search and the possibility of deferment when thinking about how you will support yourself during the bootcamp. For many, 24 weeks is already a stretch. You've got to ask yourself if you could be income-less for a year. While your career coach will understand if after the 24 weeks you feel that you simply must get a part time job, this will provide a ton of stress if you don't consider your ""worst cases"" before starting the bootcamp. This goes for any bootcamp, and even though I bet a/A's placement pace is relatively high compared with other programs  (on average roughly 6 months after graduating), you simply can't afford to make a poor choice when it comes to your finances.

Ultimately, joining App Academy was likely the best choice I could've made in a year nothing went to plan. The ISA means they have skin in the game and are aligned with your goal of jump-starting your career. The rigorous, assessment-driven structure means you will actually become something by the time you are done. And the people are worth the cost of the late hours, tears, grit, and (deferred) money.

271263,2020.0,False,The instructors are awesome!,"App Academy was a great experience overall.   You really have to be committed 100% to get through it.  I thought I was in over my head the first week or 2 but the instructors were the reason I stuck it out.  They were not only great teachers but also excellent motivators.  Once I got to the first project week I really started enjoying every day and was able to see the results of all of our hard work.  I think a/A does a great job of picking out the best candidates for the program as everyone, staff, and students, were awesome to work with.  I thought about self-learning programming early on, and after going through the 24-week online program, I know it wouldn't be possible to be where I'm at now had I tried.  A word of advice to those who are already decided to go through the program: Don't cheat yourself, treat yourself.  It is so much better to struggle early on and figure it out on your own or with a partner/instructor than to look at any answers.  Mistakes will teach you so much more than getting it right the first time.  You will make a lot of mistakes and that is a good thing.",12/10/2020,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
270271,2020.0,False,"Tech is a second gold rush, and these folks sell shovels","I attended App Academy after graduating college with a degree in Ecology and working in the US Forest Service for three years. Basically, I had no technical experience whatsoever outside of playing video games and experimenting with basic coding in the language BASIC when I was a kid. After about 7 months total of coursework and the job search, I landed a job as a software engineer at a series C startup and I feel wholly prepared to assume my new role.

App Academy has a pretty solid curriculum, and while you could conceivably learn it all on your own it's much more efficient to do it through them. While most of the TA's are recent A/a grads, the cohort leads are usually experienced engineers and can answer your in-depth technical questions. I'm pleased to say there is a decent focus on true CS concepts rather than just how to use the trending tools of the industry, which is really what counts in the job search. Specific languages and tools go out of style rapidly, but if you can internalize the core concepts of CS and learn how to pick up new things on the fly, you will be able to apply to a wide range of jobs and have a chance of passing the interviews. 

Pair programming is one of the most infuriating experiences imaginable, but I will say that it is the secret sauce that makes this bootcamp work. Left to you own devices you will likely not be motivated or focused enough to work through the whole curriculum on your own, but when paired with another person all day it makes sure that both partners are on task and making good progress. I will say I love pair programming when two people can just freeform work on the project together and throw out the driver/navigator roles, and I encourage you to suggest this to your partners if both of you are on board.

I would also say that while the A/a model works really well right now, it is definitely a crapshoot whether or not it will work for you or in the future. Right now tech is a bloated whale of high paying coding jobs that could be conceivably had with just 4-6 months of rigorous training, but I suspect that like the gold rush this will come to an end. Most of these jobs are for startups which are not profitable and are funded by VC cash. While I'm not an economist, I have heard from people who are that the tech industry is likely overvalued and may crash in the same way that finance did in 2008. Just be wary, and have realistic expectations. At the time of this review I would 100% recommend App Academy as a viable option to a tech career, but if you are reading this a year or later down the line I would do my research into the state of the industry and bootcamp placements before registering. If you are older (say, 35+) or lack a degree you may also struggle to find a job as many companies will automatically weed you out for not having a degree or discriminate against you for being an older candidate. Ditto if you are not a citizen or green card holder. While I and many of my friends found jobs within 3-6 months of finishing the program (some even sooner), I also met many people who fit into the above categories who ended up searching for upwards of a year.

The one place where App Academy really shines is the job search. This to me is where 90% of the value comes from. Anyone can learn how to code on their own, but I can honestly say without my dedicated and talented coaches I would have been dead in the water. They teach you things that you can't easily learn off the internet, things you wouldn't even think to google, and the job search formula works, at least in this current economy. Indeed, I did App Academy because I didn't think I could find a job in my old field (ecology), but after going through the job search curriculum I realize I total could have if I knew what I know now about job searching. Lastly, I'd like to mention that my first coach was a dud and pretty useless, but after he ""left"" App Academy I was assigned to two new coaches who were total rockstars. My point is your milage may vary, but for the most part I would say the coaching staff is solid.

Finally, read the fine print. The ISA money-back guarentee only applies if you finish the program and don't find a job after a year, and even then you will more than likely have to sign a job search extension adding extra months before you are eligible to get your money back. This is due to the fact that your projects and job search materials will likely not be done by the time you graduate and you will need to spend additional time working on these, during which time you are not technically job searching. Make sure that you are able to support yourself being fully unemployed for a period of 17ish months (4 months curriculum + 13 months for the search) before you start the program if you want to be safe. Of course you could just send it anyway, but you are running a risk as if you run out of money and have to go back to work you will still owe A/a $28K. Also, plan on moving to a tech hub city (most likely SF or NY) if you do not already live in one, these are the places where companies will hire bootcampers. I was lucky enough to score a remote job, but that is also mostly due to COVID. You may also be able to do so but again it is a crapshoot.

- Some lectures felt rushed and weren't paced well to flesh out concepts clearly.
- The transition from programming projects to job searching was awkward. Felt uncomfortable just suddenly switching from technical to nontechnical work. 

Tips I could give:
- Try to learn some new programming languages/concepts ahead of time (even better if before the bootcamp). I highly suggest learning Python.

If you're not ready to commit 12 - 14hrs 7 days a week to coding then this program isn't for you. The TA's are amazing (from my cohort at least), they were knowledgable and past grads so they knew what it was like to be in our shoes. The curriculum readings need to revised and updated in a few parts, thankfully TA's are there to clarify. Before the cohort starts they have you learn the basics of Ruby since the beginning of the program is focused on Ruby. I highly suggest also taking time to learn some JavaScript as well. Because you get a lot of time with Ruby and then when JS time happens you'll feel like you just got thrown into the deep end. At the time of writing this review I am just finishing week 15 out of 16, getting ready to get into the career quest part (technically already started), which is also intense. Pretty much from start of the program until you get a job you will be working you butt off. So make sure you know how to take care of yourself, exercise, get some good rest and try to maintain one hobby that is a stress reliever. Your fellow cohorts will be some of your greatest resources and best friends, you will bond over struggling together and it's a great time to make networks (you never know what companies you or any of them will get into). 

So if you are more than interested in coding, are able to not work for 4months straight or more, dedicated enough to spend 12-14hr days to learning then this is the program for you. It's not the best because it's easy, keep that in mind. As stressful as this experience has been, I am extremely happy that I did it and that I made it to the end.

267966,2020.0,False,From 0 - 100 - Intense and rewarding,"I am very glad I attended App Academy. I had been dabbling in different web development technologies for years. For example, I knew how to build web-scrapers with Python and Selenium. But I never had any formalized knowledge of the best practices to build a full-stack application. By the end of the 16 week curriculum, I was able to clone the core functionality of Quizlet.com as my final project. It was one of 3 large projects that we did.

In all we covered broad CS topics like data structures, algorithms, authentication patterns, tree traversal, among many others. And we learned specific technologies like Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, React/Redux, Node & the MERN stack. We practiced using git & github extensively. We learned Test Driven Development thru technologies like Rspec & Capybara. Most importantly, we learned to learn. For example, when it came to the MERN stack & MERN projects, the instructors stopped holding our hands and made us practice picking up a new technology ourselves.  

My cohort was supposed to be an in-person cohort, but it turned out to be online only due to Covid. At first I was upset that I wouldn't be able to interact with my instructors and classmates on a daily basis, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise - with the amount of work we had to do every day, I couldn't imagine having to spend another hour or two each day commuting.

I would give a 5-star review, but I do think it can be improved in a few ways.

1) A large part of the curriculum focuses on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I believe that this is part of the design, in a sense, because Ruby is an easy introduction into the world of programming. We had people that came from completely different backgrounds and had little prior programming experience. However, it's looking like Python & Django are becoming more popular now and I wish we had some exposure to these frameworks as well. It appears that future aA cohorts will, in-fact, be going this route instead of RoR.

2) While aA has a wealth of knowledge on App Academy Open - the main tool for content for our curriculum (it's where all of our projects, homework, and readings were housed), that portal is not very organized. If I wanted to go back and reference something we learned 4-5 weeks back - it was hard to find. I wish they made all the projects & topics we covered searchable.

To say that App Academy was intense is not an understatement. About 1/3 of our initial cohort didn't make it to the end. But it was very rewarding to have completed it.",8/28/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

That 50% 'system' meant adhering to an assessment system, a strike system for attendances and notes, and the pressures to keeping up with my cohort.

You go from console logging ""hello world"" to being able to build full stack applications in react/redux and python.

Pros
- The support from the TA's and Instructors are nice to have, especially when you aren't grasping a concept.
- 4 projects, consisting of 2 group project and 2 solo projects gives you a lot of experience working with different ideas, people, and technologies.
- Presence of a career coach makes the job search process feel much more structured.
- The focus on mini-projects while your learning really re-enforces the concepts learned for the day
- Learn Python for the online full-stack cohorts instead of Ruby
Cons
- Since I was in a Cohort with a new curriculum some of the material seemed like it was rushed or just not presented in a clear and concise way.",7/29/2020,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
266876,2020.0,False,"Effective, fast, demanding","App Academy is the 'fast track' to landing a career in tech. They focus on web design. The curriculum I went through was for Javascript and Python, and using React and Flask frameworks, but they teach you how to get there all the way from the basics of printing out hello world. 

Benefits:
* The latter half of the program teaches the frameworks mentioned above alongside building projects with those frameworks to populate a portfolio on your resume. I was delighted to find that they tackle every aspect of the job search process, since I had effectively no portfolio before a/A.
* Schedule includes weeks to focus entirely on projects and gain skills working on a team, as well as 'half-and-half' weeks to do solo projects and resume crafting, and of course many more weeks spent on new concepts.
* Schedule is very flexible, and instruction team is fair. Assessments may be curved or re-evaluated based on the cohort. 
* Every member of app academy (that I interacted with) takes responsibility if something is wrong or needs clarification, fixing, or more time. I don't remember anyone being unapproachable. 

Criticisms:
* When students get deferred to another cohort, they simply disappear. I understand it may be embarrassing to defer (although it shouldn't be - life happens, you need more time, it didn't click), but just silently removing them might not be the best solution. I felt the cohort steadily shrinking as people left, and became increasingly stressed that it would happen to me, since we were the first cohort of the year and the students ahead of us had different curriculum and couldn't join us. Most other cohorts will not be in this situation, though, as they will have new students join.
* The 24 week pace isn't as consistent as I'd like. The first 4 weeks are essentially just making sure you passed the free online intro to programming course that they offer, or getting you up to speed if you didn't. It very quickly ramps up, and some weeks have very difficult assessments while other weeks see a class average of 100%. I understand some material is very hard to assess, though - such as learning a new framework or database, where it is more trivia than anything else. 

Final jurisdiction:
I had graduated from uni without much of a portfolio, and without the ability to pass coding interviews despite my degree. In my opinion, the curriculum should be a little more polished and probably focus more on algorithms and react (the most important, most recurring subjects). As for me, I don't regret my time spent here at all, and I got a lot out of it.

It can be very emotional at times, but there are strong resources and a community to rely on. It is definitely fast-paced and work-load intensive, however it is manageable with strong mentality and using the resources given to you. My tip to anyone thinking about coming in or already in, communicate with your other cohort members and TAs if you ever need help or are feeling low. Everybody is in with the same goal and TAs were in your position before this, so do not feel like you will be hindering anybody. Without being able to ask for help or communicate well with my group, I do not think I would have been able to get through it or enjoy it as much as I did. 
Now for the cons, the pace and expectations can feel or be a bit unforgiving and relenting considering what is at stake. I know it is those same stakes that help everyone take the program very seriously, but it would be nice to know that there is a fall back plan for anyone who may have a valid reasoning for missing a week and not have to feel like they have to dropout .

266772,2020.0,False,A good way to get started,"As someone who was debating between attending App Academy or another bootcamp, I ultimately do not regret my decision to enroll with App Academy. There were several unknown factors at the time of my decision making (such as not knowing if in-person learning would become available at any point during the cohort), and I think I made the best decision I could with the knowledge I had at that point in time. With that said, there are several factors that I'd like to stress for others who may be making similar considerations:

PROS:
- This program will, at the end of the day, accomplish its goal of teaching you how to code. Or at the very least, will help equip you to continue learning more on your own after the bootcamp is over 
- It's recognized as one of the top bootcamps, which is significant since bootcamps can have a stigma associated with them in the actual workplace
- The TAs seem to genuinely want everyone to succeed, and the fact that they are all former students makes them more empathetic to the pressure on current students

CONS:
-  Curriculum or general operating procedures don't seem as polished as they could be. Several of the recorded video lectures towards the middle of the curriculum seem more dated, which didn't instill the highest sense of confidence in the product that App Academy provides
- Intense focus on passing assessments. As other reviews mention, the foundation of the curriculum is based on weekly (and towards the end, bi-weekly) assessments. Failing any of the fundamentals assessments (weeks 1 and 2) results in being deferred to another cohort, and failing any 2 of the 6 remaining assessments results in dismissal.  While this certainly keeps students on their toes, it also results in prioritizing just passing the assessment over understanding the concepts, especially if you don't have any prior CS knowledge
- Pair-programming for hours every day, especially over Zoom, is taxing. Pair programming is clearly a huge part of the App Academy experience, but as one of the first cohorts that was taught the in-person curriculum entirely over Zoom, it would have been preferable to see App Academy try to be more creative in addressing specific needs of an online experience 

All in all, if you're looking for a way to accelerate your journey into becoming a software engineer, feel that you have a good support system, and are ready to work really hard, a bootcamp might be the right choice for you.",7/24/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.3,[],3.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy
266771,2020.0,False,So glad I did App Academy.,"Honestly, I was convinced at the beginning that App Academy wasn’t for me. I’m a weirdo-artsy Latina with a ton of family commitments and chronic illness/disabilities that I knew would make the “valorization of working 90 hours a week” bootcamp model a huge challenge for me.  I contemplated dropping out from the very first week, because without a technical background and with a glitching computer I wouldn’t afford to upgrade, I felt like the “hot mess” of the class. Coding definitely doesn’t come naturally to me— every exam was a struggle because of my anxiety issues. 
Given all of this, I never expected that I would graduate this program feeling so proud and glad I stuck with it, and feeling so passionate about coding now! My TAs were incredibly supportive and there for me even as I had way more questions than it felt the average student had, and they spent hours of their time outside of formal class time to help me with material, give me pep talks, and just in general didn’t view me as an expendable number in a cutthroat environment the way I worried doing an intensive bootcamp would be like. One of my good friends died in the middle of my doing this bootcamp, and I never could have kept going to graduation if instructors and fellow students hadn’t been there for me on both a human and a programming level so consistently. 
I reveal all this info about myself because there are tons of reviews that talk about the curriculum, specifics of the frameworks they use, etc. I wanted my review to speak to someone who might be reading this and see themselves in my description of myself— not sure they can fit in in the coding/techie world, or handle a high intensity bootcamp. I won’t sugarcoat what a challenge a/A was, but I am SO, SO grateful I stuck with it, and definitely recommend App Academy, its instructors, and its community vibe that was so welcoming to this anxious new programmer!

266767,2020.0,False,A Rigorous but Rewarding Experience,"I will start with the obvious: App Academy is a very rigorous bootcamp and a huge commitment both physically and mentally. But with that comes a valuable education that really carries the name.
The Pros: App Academy has a thoroughly developed curriculum, so you can rest assured knowing that you are receiving an education that would reflect highly in the job market. It's also structured in a way that is easy to follow, starting with basic coding projects like finding prime numbers in an array and ending with building full stack web apps. When I finished the program I truly walked away feeling like a full pledged software engineer. It may seem hard at times (it will definitely seem hard at times) but you have to trust the process.
The Cons: We spent the first half of the cohort learning how to code, which in essence was finding a prime number and doing the fibonacci sequence in a hundred different ways. And then the second half ways Rails/JavaScript/React/Redux/MERN. It would have definitely been nicer if the curriculum was divided up in a better way because the concepts in the latter half are definitely more valuable but much less stressed and taught. Also, going into this I thought App Academy helps you find a job. But in truth, you're, pretty much on your own there too through hundreds and hundreds of applications.

App Academy's curriculum is prepared in a way that regardless of your technical background, you learn so so much in such little time and learn enough to compete with other aspiring software developers with university degrees in computer science. The only thing I wish App Academy did differently is to advertise themselves clearly as web development since thats basically what the curriculum is centered around. I can make a full-stack web application now, but not much more than that.

They also help you all the way with admission advisors the very same day you submit the first admission form.

Yes, a lot of the concepts can be learned by yourself with hours pouring over Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and elsewhere, but the greatest value to the intensive and immersive 16-week journey is not only the opportunity to have a glance at tech industry culture through the curriculum path and curated lectures, but the challenge at your fingertips everyday in pairing with another cohort mate to solve nontrivial projects and problem sets to actively mold into and further change the culture yourself.

App Academy is truly the one-stop-shop from beginning Ruby lessons to the job coaching that guides you the whole way after the 16-week course until you get your offer letters. Yes, you very well could go the route of learning JavaScript by yourself or maybe C by yourself, but everyone in App Academy upholds their standard everyday and provide living breathing proof that their techniques work, through their connections with tech companies all across the country and the regular alumni panels that return to talk to share their success with current students and encourage them on their way.

If you've stuck with me and read this far, start the application process and have a go at the webcam coding challenge. If you blow them away with no raise in heart rate then yes maybe this bootcamp is not for you.

266736,2020.0,False,"Significant effort, but a great experience","Overall, I had a great and rewarding experience at App Academy. They do not exaggerate the amount of work required to complete the course (often between 70 and 90 hrs a week), and the new material just does not stop coming. That said, a/A and particularly the instructors clearly want all the students to succeed, and the readings, homework, projects and lectures are all geared to make sure you hit the necessary benchmarks during the course. The general structure of regular assessments with severe consequences (can lead to being kicked out of the course) adds a significant amount of stress for students. While I understand the reasoning for this from App Academy's perspective, and believe that it is an overall positive, it can lead to a sense at points that instructors are ""teaching to the test"". 

While the pace of the bootcamp is very rapid, the structure of the course materials and projects means that you'll end up working over the same concepts multiple times after their initial introduction, the end result of which is that App Academy will teach you a huge amount of skills in a relatively short period of time. 

My cohort at App Academy was originally intended to be in person, but ended up being entirely remote due to COVID-19. I don't believe this had a large impact on the skills I've learned in the course, and the instructional team did a great job of adapting to a life on Zoom for the duration of the course. That said, you definitely lose a lot of the social aspects of an intensive bootcamp with the remote setup. 

Finally, I'm just entering the job search currently, so can't speak much to the support App Academy will provide during this period.  The job search material covered has been helpful and informative, but this final portion of the curriculum has felt more disorganized and has not inspired the confidence in this transition to job hunting that I had hoped for given the way the majority of the bootcamp was run.

Well, they made an amazing job with that! This was my first online school experience and I have to admit that everything was well managed. The only frustrating thing is that we paid the same amount even though we did not use any equipment from the school and the online courses are usually less expensive.

When they say you gonna be studying 80-100 hours a week they are right! After a day full of lectures and pair programming you will need to work on your homework, which takes between 1 and 4 hours to complete. Don’t except anybody to do the hard work instead of you.

The instructors are amazing and are always ready to help! Many times they answered our questions late night or during the weekend as well which is really cool.

The strike system is extremely annoying! You need to press buttons on an online surface indicating that you are working. If you get enough strikes, you are out! Many times I missed the 5-10 minutes “button pressing window” because I was working on a project and I forgot. For me this is complete nonsense.

You can pay all tuition upfront, all when you have a job, or a split. If you do not pay all upfront (most people do not) there is another strike system to prove you're looking for jobs appropriately.

Do not take it lightly and be prepared to devote everything you have for the long haul. The field of software development is an entire universe you could travel through your whole life and still not have touched everything. a/A's curriculum does a great job of navigating you through that universe and giving you a core understanding which can/must be built on. Bottom line: four months ago I didn't know what web development was, today I can actually build a website from scratch using in demand technologies.

Also curriculum aside be aware that they are very demanding when it comes to feedback on your end. Expect to fill out reports for how things went/are going every. single. damn. day. This sucked and was probably my least favorite part of the course.

266591,2020.0,True,0 to 100 in 16 Weeks,"App Academy is an incredibly rigorous, full-time software engineering bootcamp which will challenge you to get projects done you never would have dreamed of before. Each day begins with a structured lesson and then everyone diverges into pair programming. The program really emphasizes pair programming, where every 15 minutes you and your randomly assigned partner switch between a driver and a navigator role. I found this technique to not always be conducive to my learning when I was working with someone of a different ability. This was often a strength, though, as it forces you to explain difficult concepts to someone who might not have understood the material as well as you.
	The amount that you learn in the 16 weeks is pretty staggering. When you enter the program you are expected to solve some pretty basic algorithms, but upon leaving, you are completely ready to develop your own full-stack web application. The program was initially slated to begin in person and we were one of the first cohorts to go through completely online. The course took place over Zoom, and I think that the staff did a very good job of replicating what it would be like to be in person. The Zoom room was open 24/7, giving a space to meet with your peers after hours.
	Overall I had a really good experience with the program, but there are definitely a few things that are covered briefly or barely touched upon that I will need to independently learn after my time here. I'm about to begin my job search, and although I’m scared to apply my new skills in the real world, I believe that App Academy gave me a good foundation for what it will take.",7/20/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

266314,2020.0,False,App Academy is AWESOME,"Pros:
- App Academy really can turn any person that gives the effort,  into a software engineer
- Broad amount of topics including: TDD, scalability, algorithms, OOP, coding style, REST, security, single-page apps, and web development best practices
- Incredible instructor support throughout the course. Each cohort has an instructional team that can answer questions every day 1 on 1
-  Lifetime access to curriculum
- Huge network of App Academy Alumni post graduation
- Definitive structure to organize your path to becoming a software engineer
Cons:
- App Academy teaches a lot of material within the 6 months, so it takes all of your time (I spent ~ 80 hrs a week) and it was definitely stressful at times
- My cohort was the first cohort to complete the new Javascript/Python curriculum. At times it was disorganized, but I do know our feedback has helped them correct some of these issues

266313,2020.0,False,"Structured, Rigorous, Intense, Demanding and Successful!","*Your one-stop for the all the facts as of 2020*
The pros of App Academy are:
- Only students that can withstand the initial rigor will be accepted (a/A claims about 4-5% acceptance rate).
- There are many many success stories after graduation (a/A claims about 90-95% job placement rate).
- They actually provide real career coaching and job seeking guidance and it's part of the curriculum as opposed to being something optional.
- Their ISA or Income Share Agreement is a 100% winner, which means you don't pay upfront until after you get a Software Engineering job making at least over $50,000 and even then you pay them back in reasonable payment installments over the next 3 years.
- They have an online full-time program available so it's remote and flexible besides their in-person programs in SF and NY.
- Their culture and environment is inclusive and diverse and they allow for daily feedback, reports, and criticisms.
- You get to learn JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, Python and Flask for the online curriculum.
- You get to make some good connections with some good instructors and some good career coaches.
- Their daily and entire structure, discipline and testing is both intense, demanding which is beneficial to keep you focused and on-track and yet surprisingly flexible for the online program. You have freedom to breathe and structure yourself as well.
- It is arguably the # 1 coding bootcamp -- according to stats by a/A) -- and for the reasons I mentioned above.
The cons of App Academy are:
- If you opt for the ISA then you do have to pay them back $31,000 total at the most, which is definitely overpriced (but with a SWE or Software Engineer's salary it is easy to pay off I guess).
- As of 2020 for the online program, the curriculum needs serious revising and oversight. In the readings, there are numerous typos, grammatical errors, misleading statements that confuse the amateur, and also inaccurate coding instructions in projects that derail students and waste a lot of precious time. There are usually better outside sources that teach the same topic better. It is not exactly the same curriculum as their successful in-person curriculum model at SF and NY. Throughout the 6 months of the online full-time course, they were slow to revise, update, change, correct video, reading, exercises material and resources.
- Not all of their instructors and career coaches are competent for the job (at least for the online program I attended). Some lack in expertise of subject-matter.  Those that are proficient in subject matter are either deficient in teaching skills or completely do not know how to teach effectively (this is coming from a former teacher at all levels and a world-class curriculum developer). Their hiring team is questionable since they are behind hiring their TAs, instructors and coaches for the reasons just stated.
- They do not offer an official piece of paper (if that matters to anyone) such as a diploma, certificate as-of-to-date. I'm also not sure about academic credits, you should ask them. They might incorporate this in the future.
- You will not at all be ready when you graduate (if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). You have to put in the smart and hard work and discipline yourself after graduation for a few more months to reach a level of adequacy as a Web Developer/Coder (let alone a Software Engineer). Going through the program will not do that for you (again if you are coming from a non-CS and non-tech background). I feel like this definitely could be remedied with better curriculum development (emphasis on depth of knowledge rather than breadth like replacing the time and effort to learn some extraneous techs with more emphasis on constructing more projects and polishing them up and learning one tech stack really well since the rest can be self-taught) and  to get a better hiring team to get real teachers in there, but alas! My valuable counsel has been ignored as far as I'm concerned.
- You will have to pay them back even if you don't land a coding/web development/software engineering job with the conditions above.
- The language in their legal contract before you are accepted is extremely skewed in their favor and oppressive, so if enough students voice their concerns and demand slight changes this will be better in terms of fairness.",7/10/2020,Software Engineer Track: Online,3.7,[],4.0,2.0,5.0,app-academy

So if you don't understand it the first time, you'll get it the second. It also challenges the student to think deeply about the subject material, imparting a deep level of understanding of not just coding but computer science concepts.

With that being said, I think their online materials/readings needs definite improvement, as some of the material is outdated and written poorly. Their job search curriculum seems to be very good (I will update this review upon finding a job). Just be sure to read ALL the fine print closely because there are some nuances to their pricing model and certain rules must be followed.

Also, they only offered a $100 ""gift"" when they switched the entire in-person cohort to remote instruction due to coronavirus. They should have offered more, as some people paid upfront for an in-person experience.",5/28/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

The curriculum could use some updating to more in-demand technologies (I know they’re working on incorporating Python), but for the most part it was good, and you retain access to it indefinitely. It does drop off in quality towards the end of the instructional period and in the JavaScript portion specifically, but probably only drops as far as a ⅗ star score in some places in my opinion.

You will spend at least 80 hours per week studying and working on projects. It is all worth it at the end but can also very overwhelming if you don't know what you're getting into. 

You don't need any prior experience to enter App Academy but def previous knowledge will help you onboard faster. My advice is to spend as much time as possible before the bootcamp starts reinforcing some of the key concepts. You will not have a lot of free time once the bootcamp begins!

The first few weeks are really intensive and you will have to digest a lot of new information. I believe the key is to always keep an eye in the big picture. You don't need to fully understand every single algorithm and detail. This will come later.

I also strongly recommend you don't fall behind the program. Do your homework and assignments every day (catching up is extremely hard).

In the times when the projects/instructions were unclear or confusing, you really had to pick up the slack, work twice as hard, and learn to be self-reliant. 

As to the hours and course load, I thought that the second half of the course was significantly faster than the first half. Some concepts in the first half of the course took a week or more to learn, but most concepts in the second half were given maybe 2-3 days at most. That threw me off, and initially I disliked it tremendously and was prepared to voice my concern. However, having gone through those sped-up portions, I can say that in hindsight, I saw why the pace was as it was. What you learn in the last 2 weeks of the course is comparable to first 6-7 weeks combined. It's quick, but you come out of it feeling like ""wow I didn't know I could do that"". 

Overall, I would recommend the program for those looking for a career change, but only if you are self motivated and willing to put in the effort to go far outside the scope of the class curriculum.",5/23/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,3.0,5.0,app-academy
264877,2020.0,False,Best decision I ever made,"App Academy was probably the best decision I ever made.  I really wanted to learn how to code, and was unsure of what was the right move for me.  There are a ton of coding boot camps out there, especially ones where recruiters will consistently try to rope you in.  No, not App Academy; their acceptance rate is really low and to get in is a privilege.

While studying for App Academy (their jump start program - which was free); I learned a lot about programming.  Within two weeks, I knew how to code in Ruby and solve algorithm problems!  I was really excited to find out about all that I would learn (if and) when I got in.  Fast forward through the smooth-sailing admissions process, I entered App Academy on my first day and met a lot of great people who later became some of my closest friends!  I did not realize how hard, and intense the program would be.  There were times where I wondered if I could keep up and make it through the program (there definitely were people who got dropped - and I think it's because they didn't take it as seriously, not because they were lacking the smarts) but the teachers and my fellow peers were extremely supportive.  You never realize how much you could learn, and App Academy fosters the right culture and environment for that.

I would say that the only drawback was that sometimes the curriculum seemed a bit outdated, and the instructions weren't as clear.  But even with those kinks, we learned how to work around this which challenged us as developers (to find solutions when we were unsure of what to do). 

Anyway, I would say moving towards the end, you will find yourself feeling like a brand new person.  The alumni community is great - people who have graduated from here will talk to you on LinkedIn.

The course itself teaches you a lot of really marketable skills and I think they do a really good job of teaching those skills. Is it perfect? No. At this point it is hard to look at my own criticism and know whether it is valuable or just the product of my 6 month long high stress level. I guess if I don't get hired, it will probably validate those criticisms, but as I go on linkedin and see all of the a/A grads getting hired, it seems like if you follow the steps and commit yourself, that you will be rewarded.

264297,2020.0,False,Underwhelming and Disappointing -- But Hoping I Get A Job,"I joined App Academy with very high expectations of what the curriculum, staff, and program would be. I was disappointed at every turn. 

Time and time again, a/A staff proved to be highly disconnected with each other, and there was a deep sense of disorganization. (One eg: for about a month my instructor (someone who'd graduated from a/A 1 year prior, with no other software dev experience) actively wrote the day by day curriculum that we were actually taking.) Having attended the online curriculum, I can only speak to that: there were few to no attempts made by staff in order to foster a sense of community among the cohort, even as they spoke of such measures being undertaken (in an official capacity) in the in-person cohorts.

These faults (among others) might be admissible if the curriculum was very strong. The fact of the matter is that the written material for the Ruby course (still as of this writing freely available through a/A Online) is an amazingly written curriculum. The JavaScript portions (over half of the material), however, were a far cry from this standard. It was evident the material had not been updated, in some cases, for years. 

One of the things I truly disliked about going through a/A was that there were several times where I asked my instructor for help with a problem given in the curriculum, and they were unwilling (in one case) or unable (in another two cases) to help me. Now, I can't really fault someone who is out of school for a year, and who doesn't have any real life experience whatsoever to not know the intricacies of what I was asking (which at least in one case went above and beyond the curriculum), but I found it egregious that there was no system of escalation in place. Was there really no technical instructor in a/A's roster that could take some minutes to walk through an implementation of Knuth's Algorithm X?

These are only a couple of the gripes that I had with the system. They had feedback tools available, which I used in order to tell them about all of these incidents in turn, as they happened. I never once saw resolution, and no one ever reached back out to me about my issues. It seems to me that this shows a/A is simply very disorganized at a very high level, in need of some serious reshuffling of priorities.

As I write, my cohort is graduating in 2 days and we are starting the job search portion of the program. I have hopes for this portion still, because I figure that getting me a job is really a/A's core business, far and away from teaching me to code.

Pros:
- Peer programming really helps you work with others and explain your thoughts better

I'm reviewing anonymously and only writing this one review because I don't need the free T-Shirt(a/A does NOT require you to write a good review) but there's a couple things I'd like people to know before choosing a/A.

Pros: 
The curriculum is good because you learn a lot in a very short amount of time which proves to yourself that you're an adaptable problem solver which I think is the most important part of getting into this industry. The instructors are amazing(shoutout to Soon-Mi, Bryce Morgan, John-Michael Riley, you guys are the best), and I met a lot of really awesome people at a/A. 

Cons: 
Lectures could definitely be more interactive, a few people surprisingly got through admissions and weighed down classmates hard(If you actually did the prep-work before applying, don't worry, this probably won't be you), and new material towards the end was rushed. Is it possible to learn all of this on your own? Most definitely, but you have to be out of this world dedicated to learn it in a similar amount of time.

Clearing up a Misconception: 
Not everyone will need to put 80+ hours a week, in fact, I might even say if you're the type of person that will go all-in for a short period of time, say just a few weeks, then completely burn out, this is not the proper strategy to getting the most out of a/A. I used to be one of those people, but I learned to have dedicated time away from work. I would either finish the homework as soon as class ended or finish it just before going to bed, and the rest of my time was spent with friends, family, or alone doing anything other than looking at programming. By doing this I was able to be fully rested everyday and managed to not only get through the material avoiding burnout, but retain most of the information. This approach may not be for everyone, but this was my experience so I think it's worth considering when imagining your time at a/A.

Context: I'm definitely an outlier when it came to attending a/A, I started teaching myself programming since middle school and started a/A just a few days after turning 18. My prior experience barely helped me absorb the material better, and so long as you complete the prep-work, you'll be on track.

263383,2020.0,False,Life Changing,"Coming from a non-traditional background as a musician with no college degree or work experience, App Academy seemed too good to be true. I'd always been interested in tech, but could a bootcamp really take me from nothing to software developer in 6 months? The answer is... Yes! BUT you have to be ready to put in a tremendous amount of passion, dedication, time, and effort. There's no magic secret to App Academy... It's just a lot of hard work. No one can learn to code for you, and no one can get a job for you... That's all on you! But App Academy provides you with all the tools and support you need, and it was a truly life changing experience for me. 

The core curriculum (as it was when I attended) is incredible - I can't praise it enough. You don't just learn web development frameworks, you learn how they work under the hood. The TA's are always willing to help you when you run into issues, no matter how long it takes. And your fellow cohort mates will be fun to work with! A lot of students (including myself) were dubious of pair programming in the beginning... And although it's not perfect, the pros far outweigh the cons. Communicating your code to others is a make-or-break skill in the job search, and pair programming is a great  way to develop that skill. Some days of pairing will be better than others, but that's just life haha. 

If you're worried about the workload, don't be. Well ok... maybe worry a little haha. App Academy will keep you busy all day, every day for the entirety of the program, weekends included. This is especially true if you're striving for a deep understanding of the material (which you should be!). But learning  software development is a fun and rewarding process, and although the workload was immense, I found it enjoyable. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed, but there's a strangely satisfying feeling that comes from being thrashed day after day after day haha. I think the most difficult part is the end of the course when you're building your own projects. I'm a perfectionist, so I put a lot of pressure on myself, and worked very long hours. I had no school or prior experience, so I knew my portfolio would be a critical part in showing off my abilities as a developer. 

Once projects are completed, you will move into the job search, which is a completely different challenge. You have to balance sending out plenty of applications, preparing for interviews and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. You will be responsible for structuring your days and holding yourself accountable, and it's really easy to get lazy and unmotivated (I know I did), especially when your pipeline is empty. Also, don't expect your career coach to get you a job - there's only so much they can do. To give some detailed job search stats, I sent out a total of 333 applications, which resulted in 8 phone screens, 3 coding challenges, 2 on-sites, and 1 job. I was extremely fortunate.

All in all, App Academy was an amazing experience. However, it seems like App Academy is growing and changing, as all companies do. I can't say for certain if the experience of future cohorts will be the same as mine. I know the curriculum has been completely overhauled, and I'm not sure I would call it an improvement, based on what I've seen.

It was a great first 4 weeks of the course since we met for half days (perfect for adjusting to the course work followed).
Pair programming was a bit awkward. You are required to type for someone else for 15 minutes while they talk you through their strategy, then you switch and you are responsible for talking them through the strategy. Now finished with the course, I do see the benefit of it so make sure you are doing it.
The next 21 weeks. 
(normal ""office"" hours)
Full day programming (my schedule was 10am to 1:15pm morning lectures/programming, 1:15-2:30 lunch, 2:30-4:45 pair programming, 4:45-5:00pm break, then 5-7pm more programming (with occasional evening lectures). The pair programming definitely helps pass the time (depending on the partner). Most cohort members were at a similar level while some students with previous computer science backgrounds were far ahead of everyone else. We had an AMAZING group of instructors who helped us along the way. I feel like that is the greatest thing I enjoyed about the course. not once was I made to feel bad about struggling with the content. The instructors were genuine in their desire to help us learn and succeed. 
(after ""office"" hours)
Get ready to eat a meal, perhaps relax for 30 mins or so, then go into anywhere between 2-4 hours of readings/homework. Do not let up on this or you will fall behind. Also, think of the best way that you learn and go with it. I took paper notes on my reading the first couple of months then switched to google keep note taking half way through. Honestly, I feel like the note taking took longer but I absorbed the content better. Although it is nice to have a digital searchable archive of my notes. Try to absorb the material but not necessarily memorize it. Doing the homework will help you be ready to pair program which will keep you on track. Oh and don't forget to fill out your evening reports. We were were not told this until towards the end, but those reports (""what I learned"", ""challenges"", etc) can be useful during your job search. Because of this, it may be useful to take notes as you work for these reports (you will likely be tired by the time reports are available to be filled out).
(curriculum) 
Honestly, most of it is really good stuff. The projects give you hands on experience on the content and material you read about the night before. There are a ton of projects but it seemed like the goal was exposure not necessarily building a portofilio (until the last weeks). You have assistance when you need it and hopefully a fun partner each day that you work with. There were a few projects/assignments that I really enjoyed and some that I really didn't. Some projects are very applicable to the real world, (building websites, designing, constructing games/apps) while others are very scholastic(working on algorithms/math type problems, and writing ""lite"" versions of complicated stuff so you have a better understanding or appreciation). I honestly feel like some of the scholastic projects could be removed and the course would be enhanced. 
The two months are working solo as well as in a team to develop multiple web applications from scratch (from a pre-approved list). You will also make a portfolio and prepare for the job search (with readings and homework). This was probably my most favorite time and the hard work you did in the A05-A06 curriculum will pay off here. Feel free to check out my portfolio for samples of the types of projects. www.samgutierrez.com
(strikes)
App Academy does have a policy in place to hold people accountable to their work and being in class. For the most part, I see it as generous. You really can't be kicked out if you are doing what you are supposed to. 
The Job Search: 
After you complete your projects and your official last day the hard work isn't over.
You are given a career coach who work with you to get you ready for the job search. He or she will require multiple things to be met each week. You must get a certain number of points per week and a certain number of application or you are given a strike. 

Personal tips:
Don't over commit yourself.
My marathon:
I had already committed a couple months of training prior to signing up for a/A. This would be my second marathon and 10th or so long run event. I was on track for a 3:30 marathon PB but the marathon was not until 4 months later. Rather than paying to downgrade my marathon to a half or 10k ($100 bucks to do so), i just opted to continue with it. My training regiment had me doing a small amount of miles at the start of the course so the first month felt like a breeze. However, the next 21 weeks were living and breathing code and more strenuous running workouts. My schedule consisted of waking up early in the morning (after late evenings of homework) and training for my marathon for about an hour with long runs on weekends. Aside from that, I quickly began battling over tightness of my quads that never let up (and eventually led to injury). I got to 3 months into the course before I started experiencing Achilles issues. By the time the marathon came around I was not in good shape. Mentally exhausted from the course work and assessments and dealing with the Achilles issues, as well as unforeseen family medical emergency. There were days when I couldn't even run a mile before my Achilles just forced me to walk. Luckily, I abandoned my PB goal and was now just focused on not injuring myself but foolishly kept pushing. I ended up completing the marathon in 5 hours and 20 mins. Was it worth it....maybe? lol It felt like a bigger accomplishment than my first marathon but of course but the damage had been done. I am still struggling with Achilles injury (3 months after marathon) and fell behind during the most difficult, and honestly what I felt like, the most important portion of the course. Of course with no longer having to train, I was able to manage to get myself up to par but at more stress. My advice, think long and hard about committing to anything during this time. You will definitely benefit from having the extra time. 
Equipment:
Get a second monitor, mouse, and a decent computer if you don't have one. Laptops are good but honestly I feel like the $300 used imac that I bought is so much easier to work on then the macbook pro I worked on for one day. It is a world of difference having to constantly minimize or drag things around just to see your code. 
Set up your equipment somewhere where you will not having distractions (this will be super important during assessments) but will also help your day to day. I moved my equipment from a second bedroom  (with one window) to my living room with 3 because it got more daylight. This made a huge difference in my productivity because I felt the day longer (didn't get tired as easily), could hear birds chirping instead of the neighbor's kids on their trampoline, and could also let my dogs play outside while I monitored them through the window (as opposed to keeping them cooped all day and feeling guilty)! The sunlight also keeps you sane because depending on your time zone you may not actually be outside during daylight otherwise. 
If you have a savings and are able to invest a bit more a Solid State Drive would be helpful.

More prepared to build real applications, code and answer higher level data structures / algorithm questions than my friends with CS degrees said they were when they started job searching. In fact a bunch of people in my cohort already had legit CS degrees. Only side-note is that I noticed a BIG difference in the general vibe of the program based on what instructors you get to work with. I switched from the SF cohort to Online when I found out I was having a baby (which they were very supportive of) and it was like a completely different bootcamp just because I got some over-the-top friendly instructors. Not a serious issue though because a/A&#39;s written and video resources are fantastic, and all the instructors are super capable engineers that can help you track down and conceptually understand any bug you hit in your code. Other side note, I strongly recommend dabbling through one or two Udemy courses before starting a/A though if you literally have no coding experience (I did the first half of Colt Steele&#39;s Web Dev Bootcamp, loved it). Not because you necessarily have to, but it&#39;ll make a/A more fun and less stressful. That said, my BFF from the program had zero coding experience and was working at Home Depot before doing a/A.

263254,2020.0,False,Best decision I ever made.,"Before App Academy I was already moving towards another bootcamp since I was in their prep course. Unfortunately, the experience decimated me to the point where I questioned if a career move was right for me. As a last ditch effort, I did App Academy’s prep due to the guarantee. I was honestly blown away. There was an honest attempt to break down the concepts and present it in a way that anyone, even with no coding experience, could understand. From there I was sold, never looked backed and made it into the immersive program.

Daily life as a student:
- Days are M-F from 8AM - 5PM PST.
- There are 6 assessments, failing 2 will get you kicked out so there is a lot of pressure involved
- While in immersive, you’ll mostly be pair programming working on projects
- There is homework every night which needs to be completed for the following day. Some of the homework can be 4-5 hours long, so after a long day of work, you have more work
- After immersive, you’ll spend most of your time working on projects while learning some new concept and materials in between

I will say for my individual experience:
- My instructors were amazing. They were really chill, knowledgeable, and their support is one of the things I will always speak highly of.
- All of my cohort mates are awesome. Everyone has different backgrounds, but you start to lean on each other for support, and build connections you didn’t expect.
- I learned a lot, it doesn’t always feel that way. But the knowledge you gain from the begin to end is substantial, and that is a big plus.

I can’t speak for job search since I’m only beginning, but what I can say is I like my career coach. His plan and expectations make sense and I’m hopeful it’ll land a job soon.

However, I never created a full stack project, like cloning a website, writing all the backend and frontend; even though I am still finishing the fullstack, this was one of the most awesome experiences. You spend a lot of time pair programming. 

Tips: You don't have to come in knowing anything; I had taken some programming classes before and I'm glad I did. There are students at many different levels starting. A couple of CS majors in my class and for them, they got through the material easier/got through more of the projects.

I have a very good opinion of App Academy because I can see the results of all my work and studying. I'm able to make amazing web applications and I have a good understanding of the coding languages and tools taught by App Academy.

It is a lot of work, though. I woke up at 7 and commuted 40 minutes to App Academy, where I coded from 9AM to 6PM.

It's hard, but it's not impossible. Just be prepared for it and keep your end goal in mind.

 Furthermore, I've been talking to friends and hear about the friends of friends who have gone through coding interviews. Many of those interview topics have already been covered by App Academy.

If I have to nitpick about things, it is that I don't think that we reviewed enough material as we progressed through the course. We learned ALOT. Which means we also forget a lot.

This is not bad though because as a software engineer you'll always have to figure stuff out on your own and thats totally ok. My only real criticism of App Academy is not allowing you to use laptops in lecture. Honestly it bothered me more than it should but it definitely took me and my attention away from lectures, as i suck at taking notes. Just imagine trying to follow along to dry code while watching someone give you a lecture Redux. The days i got away with having my laptop in lecture, i was completely focused took incredible notes in notion, and learned a bunch. The days i didn't which was most, i didn't pay attention, i slacked off, and made up for it during pair programming and at night, which was super annoying.  If you cant tell already it really bothered me. 

When it comes to the curriculum, there are parts I definitely disagree with but overall they jam pack you with more than you'll ever be able to grasp all at once. Which is excellent. From high level algorithms to LRU Cache, and hashing functions, to understanding the foundations of a MVC framework. They definitely need to teach hooks in React though, and get away from only teaching class Components. It's out of date, compile rate is way slower and the industry is staying away from class Components, unless its dealing with error handling. They need to teach less ruby and more React. Ruby is a really beautiful but also a really easy language. The amount of time they focus on it is probably better spent elsewhere.

Job Support so far is alright, everything seems to out of order though. Not sure where to go or what to do most times. The lectures are way too long and could be shortened by 2/3, or a simple email.

It was great! That said, as I've mentioned, it was tough; mentally, physically and emotionally, just all around exhausting. 

If you are considering a/A, definitely think it over, don't just jump into it.  If you have family who will be around/helping during your time in the program, talk it through with them as well because it can be hard for them too.

My classmates were warm, friendly, and clever and I am happy to call many of them friends. You will come out of the program with 3 projects, a good understanding of the job market at an entry level but most importantly you will learn HOW to learn to code and find resources and work through problems on your own because there is so much to learn, especially starting from scratch. 

Cons: Lectures seemed very shallow and time-consuming and not the most helpful beyond a surface level overview. TA to student ratio was not the best and so at times it took a while for a question to be answered. Job search curriculum is generic and arbitrary deadlines are annoying to deal with when working on several other projects at the same time. Struggling through projects is difficult as you are not taught everything you need to know but also rewarding when you are able to learn and solve problems on the fly.",4/1/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],4.0,4.0,3.0,app-academy

The environment at app academy models a traditional school but with much more support and inclusiveness. Their policy of teaching by pair programming was in my opinion very effective because it was molding us into better communicators and team mates while also leveling out the learning curve. I did feel like getting towards the end of the class the gap between students was too apparent to effectively pair program without a large knowledge gap, but for the most part it was a great way to learn. I did feel like the curriculum was a little bit lacking, they tend to glance over a lot of WHY things work and worry more about HOW to get things to work, but that can also be expected in a rigorous 4 month bootcamp.

Cons: It often took a long time for a TA to come help because the student to TA ratio was pretty skewed. I really disliked the lectures as we just all sat and stared at the projector with no desks or laptops. The job search curriculum has been pretty generic and I don't see much value in it.

263130,2020.0,True,A rewarding experience,"I attended aA from December 2019 through March 2020, doing the full stack curriculum. This curriculum teaches you how to program from scratch starting with Ruby, then SQL, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and finally React & Redux. I came into this program with prior programming experience, so the first month of so was basically review to me while most of my peers were learning the basics of programming.  

I can say that I came away from this course as a better programmer, and fully equipped with the tools necessary to find a job as a software developer. The pace is very fast - you're learning something new every day. It ramps up in speed - we spent the first month working with Ruby, and at the end we went through the Javascript curriculum in only a week. The pair programming experience is great - 95% of my classmates were there to learn and were motivated. You'll be doing pair programming for 10 weeks with a new person everyday, so at the end of it you make some pretty good friends and networking connections out of it.  95% of the stuff you learn is useful; you end up using most of it for the 3 projects at the end that you are required to do. The instructors are great and all of them are there to help you succeed and do better.

I am currently in the job search curriculum portion, where I get lectures on topics such as networking, writing cover letters and resumes, and interviewing. After I graduate, I will be working with a career coach from App Academy for upwards of a year until I find a job. Once you graduate, it doesn't stop - they expect you to spend 8 hours a day, 40 hours of week working on finding a job. If you work better with imposed deadlines, then this is immensely helpful as it prevents you from procrastinating. 

Overall - I think that the program is worth the value in tuition. I would recommend payment upfront rather than the deferred model, since you pay less and there's less pressure to find a job after you graduate. But if you like that sort of pressure, then maybe the second option is better for you after all.

263096,2020.0,False,Can't recommend it enough,"For those that are considering a bootcamp and live around the SF area, App Academy is absolutely worth it. What I love most about App Academy is that despite my prior experience in programming, I was constantly challenged and learned something new each day. The curriculum is rich enough that even the more experienced programmers will feel like they're getting something out of it. I can't recommend this program enough for those that are looking for a bootcamp. 

However, my main suggestion is that prior to applying or even considering this bootcamp, you should learn to code. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the purpose of a bootcamp is not just to teach you how to code, it's to help get a job to build a career. In addition, learning to code prior gives you a sense on whether or not you even enjoy learning how to code. If you do, then definitely put in some time to learn prior to applying. It not only prepares you for the admissions interview but also will help you immensely in the program. App Academy is incredibly competitive and while there are many people that come into this program with little to no knowledge of how to code and ultimately succeed, there are many that don't make it pass the first few weeks. This is simply because the program has a strike out policy where if they deem that you're too far behind in their expectations of where you should be, you could get dismissed. 

App Academy is a great investment and I highly recommend that those that are considering this program will also consider the time and commitment. Everyone will do whatever it takes to make sure that you learn the material and get that job but only if you're willing to do your part in that process as well.

Pros:
• Rich curriculum of learning full-stack development and job searching 
• Has career coaches that work extensively to help you find a job 
• Relatively affordable: for those that can't pay the entire tuition out of pocket, the deferred plan is a great option that asks for a deposit and a fraction of your first year's income. This is a great choice because other bootcamps have policies that extend over 1 year and the repayment is little compared to what you'll be making as a software engineer. 
• Learn by doing: The curriculum emphasizes learning by doing. So you'll be working on a lot of projects but don't worry. The projects are not expected to be completed. They're meant to be for YOUR learning experience.

Cons:
• San Francisco is expensive. If you don't live in San Francisco, expect to dedicate some time commuting to and from the campus (SF traffic sucks). 
• Doesn't necessarily take into account everyone's learning style. I learn better when I'm coding along with someone but lectures don't allow for computers so it's difficult to pay attention when I have to write notes with pen and paper while trying to follow lecture slides. 
• Too much pair programming: App Academy focuses on pair programming to get students to learn how to communicate and work with partners. This style is the majority of the program.

263092,2019.0,True,App Academy,"My experience at App Academy was great! I had so much fun learning how to code and am grateful for this life-changing experience! Like many of the online sources say, it IS really challenging. In the 3 months that you dedicate to App Academy, it is essentially the only thing that you can focus on. However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):

1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.

2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum.

3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum.",3/30/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

Prepare to enter a demanding, yet nurturing environment composed of students and instructors who train you to overcome your personal hurdles and transform yourself into a competitive software engineer. There is no hand-holding here: you will be dismissed if you fail more than two assessments, and you'll need the self-discipline to keep up with the curriculum. However, your classmates will be there to cheer you on, and you'll experience the pride and joy of completing a full-stack project and a JavaScript project all by yourself.

I do wish that the curriculum had taught a different tech stack when I attended (Ruby on Rails isn't very hip these days), and the school's connections to the tech industry could be a little better.

After comparing the prep-work between other bootcamps and aA, it became obvious that App Academy's curriculum was far superior to the others - leading me to eventually choose it over the other options.

After the course, the practical material I learned and the depth to which I learned it allowed me to successfully complete a full stack onsite interview and land a position within 2 weeks of finishing aA. While this was not the norm, I believe that overall App Academy is a valuable asset to someone wishing to enter the field of software engineering.

I knew some Python prior to attending, but almost all of my coding skills I learned at a/A. The instructors were former a/A students so they teach understanding the student's perspective and are always willing to help. You pair program every day which to me was great because I loved having the opportunity to work with all of my cohort mates. Towards the end of the bootcamp, you build a full stack clone of an app of your choice which is invaluable in terms of job searching. 

All in all, a/A was certainly stressful at times but highly rewarding in terms of the knowledge and skills you gain.

261770,2019.0,False,"Well structured, but the end result is really up to you","The main learning section of the course was really well structured, which made it ideal for me (someone who needs critical timelines and an uncompromising schedule to not slack off).   The fact that you have to learn basics yourself and interview to get into the program inspires more confidence than other bootcamps who will follow up call you to make sure you are still interested.  App academy seems to survive on its reputation, and I know multiple students in just my cohort who came to A/a because a friend or sibling already went through the program with success.  I was really surprised at myself how much I learned so quickly.  I tried self-learning for a year, but couldn't get to a point where I was comfortable knowing what to learn to do what I wanted.  However now, I don't know everything, but I feel confident I know how to learn any language/framework with enough time due to the solid foundation App Academy provided.

It's not necessarily a fault of App Academy, they do the best they can in such a short time frame, but I wish there were more employers willing to at least give me a phone screen to prove I know my stuff.  You just can't get the reputation a 4 year degree will get you at a bootcamp.  Especially considering how undergraduate internships are the new start of the pipeline to full time employment.  The job search portion is arguably more grueling due to financial stress and comparative lack of structure.  You still have weekly targets to meet, but there just aren't enough qualified coaches to help you through the post-graduation section of job-searching (especially considering most coaches are previous App Academy graduates who are only working there until they can find a better job offer themselves).

Overall a worthwhile experience, and this is written from someone still in the midst of the job search.

261714,2020.0,False,Incredibly rewarding experience,"I am incredibly grateful to have gone through App Academy. I went from almost no knowledge of coding to being able to build a full web app within a matter of months. Here are some key takeaways: 
- The 40 hours per week of class-time can seem daunting at first, but they do a good job of splitting the time between lecture and pair programming. You usually see people saying it takes 80-100 hours commitment per week, but I'd say 70 hours per week is more accurate if you are good at managing your time and staying focused 
- I think a lot of students have mixed feelings about the amount of pair programming we do. Although it is definitely not the most efficient way to code, it really teaches you how to communicate your thought process well and learn to be open to others' ideas
- The student to TA ratio is fantastic. If you aren't too proud to ask for help, you have all the resources you need to succeed
- My main criticism is the breakdown of time spent learning different languages. We spent 4 weeks learning Ruby, but had only 1-2 weeks of instruction on any other language or framework. During our final projects we were expected to learn a new framework over the course of a weekend with minimal to no guidance from the instructors. Of course, you can't learn everything there is to know about coding in only 4 months, so they tend to focus more on practical application rather than theoretical knowledge or deeper understanding of the material",2/6/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

261702,2019.0,False,Getting a job was relatively easy after completing the bootcamp.,"App Academy is known as one of the top coding bootcamps in the country and for good reason. The curriculum is stringent and top-notch. It is a very selective process to even get into the program and when you do the intensity only increases from there. It is a bootcamp after all. This bootcamp is probably the equivalent of the Navy Seals or Green Berets bootcamp but for your programming skills (and your mental capacity).
Most of the stress comes from having to pass 6 assessments in order to stay in the program. They range from topics like basic sort and search algos in Ruby and JS to SQL queries and Rails backend basics. I liked the intensity and learned a lot from the weekend study sessions and nightly homework. I cannot imagine another bootcamp having better, more informed, and brilliant Technical Assistants (teachers) than AA. 
Finally, once you struggle through your final projects (building a full-stack application) and learn a ton from this process, you enter the job search curriculum. App Academy is just as stocked with good strategies for landing a well-paying job. Despite me not having the best projects and it being the Christmas / New year holidays, I managed to get some good traction with recruiters and hiring managers to land some interviews and ultimately get a job offer early in the new year. If you can make it through the 3 months of intense technical curriculum, then getting a job is relatively easy, especially in a market like NYC. If you don't mind being uncomfortable in order to grow and be pushed to your limits, this is the place for you.
I would highly suggest this bootcamp for anyone thinking of doing this type of thing.",2/5/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
261696,2019.0,False,"Absolutely worth it, if you can push yourself","The curriculum is challenging and fast-paced, but absolutely worth it for the experience you get that truly makes you competitive in the job market. After graduation you will have the skills to build full-stack applications and websites, and just as importantly, you will have the knowledge and confidence to learn any new technology that you're interested in that wasn't covered in the course. Most of the work is done via pair programming, which can be uncomfortable in the beginning, but it grows on you and is a really useful skill to have. TA support during the class portion is also really good.
In terms of job support after graduation, I don't find it nearly as successful as the scholastic curriculum. I don't I think App Academy is necessarily at fault, I think it's just really difficult to land your first professional job in general.

Not all the TAs are available to help (they may have other responsibilities), so that might explain why it would sometimes take hours to get our questions answered like other reviews have mentioned. They say they do that on purpose to try to get us to find out answers ourselves like how we would in the real world. Indeed, my googling skills have gotten so much better since I've started App Academy. While having such a big class has its downfall, I am actually really glad I get to meet so many wonderful people. Majority of the curriculum involves pair programming so you get to work with a different person everyday.

Assessments make you feel the pressure, but they will make sure to give all practice materials to get through the assessments with ease. Pair programming is best and a/A wanted students to get best out of it focussing on understanding the material rather than project completion.

Projects at the end are really helpful to have deeper understanding of the material from the start. If you are willing to spend all your time and effort for the duration of the course, then go for it. Good Luck!",2/5/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
261677,2020.0,True,A learning environment with like-minded individuals,"I have finished the instructional portion of App Academy and am currently transitioning into the job search portion of App Academy.

If you are comparing App Academy against other bootcamps, I think App Academy is the better option as of this writing. I have a roommate attending Hack Reactor (HR) and my understanding is that HR is equivalent to the second half of App Academy. In practice, this means you lose out on learning a second language (Some companies, such as Google, care about how many languages you learn) and do not  learn databases or CSS as deeply.

If you are wondering whether you are a good fit for App Academy, I would follow the advice of those before me and go through Harvard's computer science Edx program before attending. It is not imperative that you fully understand everything from that course, but a general idea of the concepts helped me excel at App Academy. I came from a political science background, but I understood programming concepts thanks to predicate logic, the Harvard Edx course, and from video games. So, you do not need extensive knowledge of coding, but attending App Academy without some exposure is a mistake.

The program itself is rather rigorous and you will find that you live under a rock for the duration of it. Our cohort had the easiest time because our program aligned with several holidays. Nevertheless, I found myself skipping my normal gym routine in favor of late-night studying. The most telling part of the workload was when I caught the flu and missed an entire week at App Academy. During that time, I still did the work, on my own, and turned it in to avoid strikes (Yes, you get strikes while sick). I often thought I could rest and make up for lost time later that night, but when I compared my pace to my classmates, I found that not only were they working while I was resting, but even during the hours I felt I could pull ahead.  Simply put, there is no escaping the time-sink involved in this type of program. When we finished the material and began personal projects, I found myself running on four hours of sleep per night.

How enjoyable the experience is will largely depend on your fellow students. I felt as if I shared a lot of experiences with my cohort and that they made the experience enjoyable. It is impossible for me to say whether other cohorts will be as exceptional. You will find yourself interacting with at least half the cohort due to paired programming and your breaks will be spent discussing the material. Personally, I enjoyed pair programming since I value the time I spend with my cohort, but some people felt it was not as enjoyable -- it really depends on your preferences. 

My biggest criticisms of this program are its strike policy and location. As previously mentioned, you accrue strikes while sick and that inclined people to attend class, with the flu, during my time at App Academy. My other criticism is that it is located in rather expensive places. It might not be feasible to relocate, but New York and San Francisco are infamously expensive locations and are not necessarily the nicest places (In terms of cleanliness). Be prepared to budget if you attend. I know some people mitigate this cost by traveling from afar, but given the tedium of the program, I would highly advice against it.

Overall, I think the program pushes acquainted individuals to become great software engineers.I wouldn't recommend it to people with zero exposure to coding, but a little preparation will alleviate that concern. I was surprised to read that professional developers are paying to learn material App Academy teaches such as React and Redux. I often impressed my software engineer friends when I told them what we learned/were learning, so I believe the curriculum is rather exceptional.",2/4/2020,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

261659,2020.0,False,It's a marathon but will teach you skills with no prior experience,"App Academy is a truly intensive 16 week program that requires dedication to get the most out of it. This bootcamp is ideal for people with little to no prior experience in software development and will teach you the knowledge necessary to build a full stack web app by week 12. For people with some prior experience, the beginning will be a little slow as the material is tailored to new developers. Being in the latter camp, I still found this program very valuable in many ways that self-study can not compare. The structure of the curriculum and the quality of the projects students work on everyday really reinforce the concepts taught. The guidance of the teaching assistants and the camaraderie of other students provide a great learning environment that will push you to stay on track.

Now for some criticisms. This bootcamp will teach you very basic fundamentals early on and then transition quickly into being focused on frontend web development. The practical skills taught are all in frontend frameworks. This is great to train students to be able to jump into a junior frontend role and be productive, but not so great if you desire to work backend. Now of course a/A is just providing the building blocks to launch students into a career in software development and students can certainly transition into a backend role, but it likely won't be the first job after a/A. The program is 16 weeks and can not replace a CS degree. A lot of self-study is necessary right after the program ends to shore up deficiencies in the data structures and algorithms.

As for the SF campus, the building is located in Financial District / Embarcadero which means rent will be very expensive if you want to live nearby. If you are moving to SF, look for housing right away after being accepted and see if you can find a roommate with a fellow student in the cohort. The equipment on campus is adequate but some upgrades could be made with the office chairs. Having your own relatively modern laptop is a must.

All in all, I am very pleased with what I've gained through App Academy in the last 4 months. Putting in 60-100 hours per week was all worth it and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

261552,2020.0,False,"Time Consuming, Stressful, Intense, but worth it","I made it through the storm that is App Academy. App Academy is the most time consuming and stressful thing I have done in the last few years(And that includes starting a business).  My cohort started with around 25 people...  In the end, there were only 10 of us left(including a coder that was rolled back into our group).  Even though App Academy hours are from 8 am - 5 pm pacific time, there is usually a few hours of homework and readings every night as well. I usually found myself going to bend around midnight to 2 am studying every night since I was in central time.

In addition there are six assessments which you must score around an 85% to 90% or better in order to pass or after two fails you may be asked to leave the program.  So between studying for these assessments to remain in the program, doing the nightly homework videos, readings and coding projects where you are expected to take on and learn new content,  and the daily grind of 8 am to 5 pm (or 10 am to 7 pm if you are in the mid-west), and any ongoing projects or other fun homework that might be assigned, you might find yourself incredibly busy.

During the week it is pretty much impossible to find time to get out or do anything social. I made sure to keep myself active though and workout daily.  I think the assessments create a very stressful learning environment for the students and aren't a good measure of a coders ability. I saw many coders very stressed about the upcoming assessments. For some this brings out the best and motivates people to do better. For others, they would simply self-destruct.

What I love about App Academy is that it has taught me to think like a coder instead of having to resort to copy and paste or following tutorials to create websites, write backends, set up API endpoints, create games, or manage the flow of an app. I feel confident that I can build anything or learn any new kind of technology stack very quickly and use the thought process  that I have gained from App Academy. 

I was bummed at first that they taught Ruby as I consider it a dying language(Yes Ruby is still in demand). Even though it has many easy and useful and methods that can making coding much faster and simpler, it appears that it is not being used nearly as much by companies as Javascript, Python, Java, and some other languages. (By the way App Academy is switching to Python and I am excited to get access to their content). However, App Academy taught me Javascript as well, React, the MERN stack with MongoDB.  I learned GraphQL, docker, postresql, how to make GeoQueries,  organize my code better, and take advantage of object oriented programming. I mastered algorithms,  recursion, data structures, became great at debugging and learned many other things.

Their curriculum is on a whole other level from what you will usually find. If you complete the course, you will a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures,  how servers work, requests, responses, big-O, LRU cache, optimizations and many other things. We did things like creating our own version of Rails Active Record to see how Ruby on Rails worked behind the scenes. We did the same thing with JQuery. Once again, its more than just copy and paste. It's real understanding that you can take to any other endeavor.

And what I have found, when picking up a new language, framework or stack, is that the thought process is pretty much the same. I have been able to teach myself Dart to make mobile apps in Flutter and pick up python very quickly just using the techniques and knowledge that I gained from App Academy.

The Instructors are excellent, brilliant problem solvers, very knowledgeable and almost always available, even on the weekends or if you have a late night question.

I am currently about to start the Job Search phase, so we will see how this converts to finding a job. However, I feel very confident in my abilities.  Would I have put in 19 hours a day in coding for 6 months without App Academy? Probably not. App Academy also gave me streamlined curriculum to be prepared for the job search and and to be ready to build anything, instead of wasting my time on many youTube videos or Udemy courses that aren't useful don't help you to actually learn to solve problems like a coder.

Even beyond the job search, this has definitely changed my life, since I have many website and app ideas, and now I possess the skills to bring them into reality. I am no longer unsure where to start or how to attack a problem. App Academy has helped to break down problems and return solutions.

It takes everything you have. I was only able go through the course because I had an amazingly supportive partner that did everything while I studied and coded. Seriously, you will have no time to do anything besides study, code, and sleep. If you do anything else your performance will suffer. Be prepared to give up everything else in your life for the duration of the curriculum. I was putting in 80 hours per week and more. You get very few reprieves during your time in App Academy; it's called a bootcamp for reason. Do the readings. Do the homework. I will repeat: DO THE READINGS, DO THE HOMEWORK. Pass the assessments. You won't have time for anything else. You will do fine.

That being said, the curriculum is fairly good/decent, and will tell you what you need. Some spots are a bit lacking. The real value, however, is in the instructors. Without their guidance this would have been a much more difficult mountain to climb. My cohort was incredibly fortunate to have a pair of amazing instructors who not only did what App Academy expected them to do, but went well above and beyond. They gave up weekend days to help us study for assessments, one of them helped us from the airport on their day off while traveling, stayed after class to answer any questions, recorded these after-hours sessions for those who were unable to attend due to various reasons. In addition to that, make friends! You will help them, then they will help you. You will understand something they don't; they will understand something you won't. I made a tight-knit group and we have been helping each other since. You will keep each other accountable. The full stacks might seem a little rushed, but you will come back to them later.

The job search is definitely another mad dash afterwards. Just because the curriculum is over, doesn't mean the bootcamp is; it's over when you get hired. You are give a lot of help and support to get you started; resume help, portfolio site help, how to deploy your full-stack sites, and more. Afterwards, once you are given the green light to start applying (they might keep you from it for a week so you can polish your full-stack projects and do a mock interview to make sure you are ready), you are required to do at least 25 job applications per week to hold to your end of the tuition contract, along with continual studying/improvement of your skills; all of this is logged in an online system.

Due to the competitive tuition models, there is definitely a ton of filtering in the admissions process, as well as several systems/assessments in place throughout the course to make sure students are giving their full effort and not just along for the ride. Transition from 12 week to 16 week is apparent and still being worked out, but the sheer amount of material and resources available is truly incredible. This being said, this is a double edged sword in that there is always something to be working on and you will never really feel like you ""completed"" anything before moving on... but that's the point. Constant exposure to a wide range of material day in and day out. Pair programming daily; get ready to work with others and be able to explain your thoughts and programming decisions on the fly. Really forces you to do the daily homework and show up prepared each day, ready to learn even more in lecture. Job and career coaches are really dedicated to helping you get your materials together and seem to genuinely care about your success after the program ends. Course work is really relevant and tailored to languages and frameworks that are considered relevant/trendy in the industry, as well as plenty of attention given to theory/algorithms/more theoretical material that will help in interviews, as well as just general programming knowledge.

Just for a bit of context I am a 21 year old high school dropout that didn't finish the 10th grade and was in and out of homeless/domestic violence shelters with my mom and sisters. sufficient to say we missed a lot of school. My son was born when I was 16, married my high-school sweetheart at 17, and  my daughter was born when I was 19. The point is that there was there was every reason for me to think that I wasn't good enough to have the title Software Engineer. However, 3 weeks ago I finished the 24 week online course and can say with a high degree of certainty that I will land a job in the next few months (Will update onChange). This is not say that the course is not hard. It was the single hardest thing that I have ever done. When they say 100 hours a week they mean it. I personally did at least 16 hour days 7 days a week for 20 weeks( throughout the main part of the course). Did many all nighters and even more 20 hour days to stay caught up. Basically if i wasn't sleeping/eating I was studying. App Academy doesn't just teach you all of the skills to be  a successful Software Engineer, as corny as it is to say they really do teach you how to learn. The very dedicated,patient and knowledgeable T.As brake vary hard concepts down to the absolute base foundation, then start building on it at a pase that is continously pushing you passed what you thought was your limit.

258469,2019.0,False,It works!,"I can attest that App Academy works: I went in knowing only what I dimly remembered from intro comp sci back in college, and I’m about to start my first job as a software engineer. 

I’d say the greatest strengths of the program are the challenge, the support, and the accountability. The principal three-month curriculum is incredibly intense—expect 60-hour weeks at absolute minimum—but it takes you through the skills and concepts you need to know and forces you to put in the necessary work to really learn them. The instructors and TAs, though they can occasionally be overwhelmed (many are graduates of the course), are always on hand to offer helpful feedback that’s often critical to bringing together your understanding of a concept. It’s all about putting you in a structure that incentivizes you to actually put in the work, and this continues even after graduation, as you get individualized coaching and reporting tools that make sure you regularly apply to jobs and continue working on projects and coding challenges. This is especially valuable because the job search can take time—around three months in my case—and you’ll absolutely have more to learn after you graduate. Twelve weeks can’t cover every nuance of software engineering.  

As far as downsides, the instruction is sometimes shaky, as I said above, though years in business have polished the curriculum to the point where you’ll usually have pre-prepared resources to help you out if worst comes to worst. Your continued participation in the course depends on you passing the regular assessments, which is a major source of stress even if you have a handle on the material and prepare well. The assessments themselves also can feel more like tests of memorization than genuine reflections of how much you’ve learned. Last but not least, despite App Academy’s stated (and admirable) goal of bringing people from more diverse backgrounds into the tech industry, most of the classes seem to be overwhelmingly male, even more so than the industry as a whole. That won’t be an issue for everybody, but it’s worth mentioning.

The TA's are supportive and knowledgable about the curriculum, as they were students themselves prior to becoming a TA. They can be overstretched but they do their best to help. 

The striking system for assessments kept me accountable to stay on track. We got one free fail and had to do a retake if we failed a second assessment - failing the retake meant dropping out. This can be daunting but there's a great amount of support and resources. Your chances of failing decreases immensely if you reach out to the people around for help when you're stuck and devote a strong amount of time into studying. a/A also provides practice assessments for test preparation and they will recommend you to do them many MANY times.

I had so much fun learning how to code and am grateful for this life-changing experience! Like many of the online sources say, it IS really challenging. In the 3 months that you dedicate to App Academy, it is essentially the only thing that you can focus on. However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):

1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.

2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum. 

3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum. 

Closing thoughts:
I definitely don't know as much as those who dedicated every minute of their lives studying and working on App Academy, but I can confidently say that I was one of the happiest people there and truly enjoyed everyday of my experience with low stress. My approach was all about balance in my life, and I succeeded and made it to the end! Obviously, people work differently. If you need to lose some sleep to catch up on studying, that's fine. If you need even less days to study and can spend all weekend relaxing, that's fine too. I think the main thing is to not worry about what/how others are doing, and only focus on yourself and what YOU need to be successful and healthy.",10/10/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

256269,2019.0,True,I learned a lot from here.,"I'm decided to give coding a try after realizing that I did not want to pursue a career as a Physician Assistant. At first, I was really skeptical about joining a bootcamp. Questions like ""Am i smart enough to code?"", ""Can I really learn all that in three months?"",  and ""Will I get a job?"" were always in my head before I decided to do this. Currently, I'm a few days from graduation from a/A and I think it was the right choice. I am smart enough to code, I did learn a lot in the three months, and I believe I will get a job because most graduates on average find one within 1 - 6 months. The process of the bootcamp though was really time consuming and you are literally coding every single day for basically the whole day. However, it is only in this type of environment where you can learn so much in three/four months, where you can really get grasp whether you would like a job in this industry or not. A lot of the reviews I've read before a/A said that it was really stressful, but I personally did not feel that way. I feel like if you do what you're supposed to do, and follow the curriculum,  you can go through it not be stress. Plus, you also get to meet a lot of cool and smart people along the way.

The way their course system is set up, once the immersive starts, you are pushed into the deep end and must devote 100% of your time to learning to succeed. They do a very good job of integrating solo work, pair programming, and whiteboarding to truly learn how to work with other people.   The curriculum gives you just enough of a technology to truly understand it, then moves on to a new subject right away. Things move at a very fast pace, and it’s very easy to get behind early if you take it too easy, and if you do this at the begining it snowballs.

The main draw of App Academy over other programs is that they are invested in your success. They make the curriculum hard on purpose because they only want people with the drive to succeed.  There is more curriculum than anyone could reasonably get through in a normal day, so be 100% prepared to have no life while you’re working through it.  The 80-100 hours a week people talk about is not an exaggeration.

My favorite part of App Academy at was the networking and the amount of friends I was able to make in such a short span of time. By the end of my cohort, I was acquainted with most of the students and had developed meaningful relationships with them. In addition, my cohort mates were an excellent asset when it came to asking for help when the TAs were busy helping other students. 

App Academy's deferred tuition model was the reason I chose to attend. As a risk-averse individual, I was instantly drawn to this business model because I knew this meant that they truly believe in their program.  If I was ever stuck on a project, the TAs, who are very knowledgeable of the material and super friendly, would help me within a moment's notice. While they do not guarantee you a job after graduation, this is probably the closest thing to a guarantee that you can get. All of the career coaches are invested in your success and will give you all the tools and resources you'll need to succeed.

Instructional TA review: 
Everyone on  the TA staff is very friendly and care very much that all the students are learning and not lagging behind too much. However, App Academy does not have enough TAs and students do not always get the support they need. In addition, there is a pretty big gap in technical ability between the TAs. At times, TAs will have to ask another TA for help to help the student. 

Curriculum review:
As some reviews have already stated, the JavaScript curriculum needs to be more refined. 
A majority of App Academy grads will find positions as front end developers or become full stack developers but their job will have them primarily do front end stuff. I think, due to this fact, App Academy focuses too much on front end. App Academy is continuously tweaking their program and I hope that they shorten the ruby section and make the JavaScript section more extensive by covering node.js and express.js in depth instead of just focusing on React / Redux. 
As for CSS and HTML, which App Academy dedicates time to teaching, I think it is better to leave students to learn from the great and free online resources out there. Just assign homework that needs to be completed and turned in to make sure students do the CSS. 

Culture: 
App Academy states that it is a professional environment but it is far from it.  They will take violations of their diversity and inclusion principles very seriously but besides that, App Academy does not enforce students to keep professional behavior. This leads to a more relaxed environment, which helps the social aspect of the boot camp, but does get in the way of focusing on coding since people are allowed to have loud conversations about any topic they want without consequences. 

Job search: 
There seems to be adequate support. Again, because of the number of students accepted to App Academy, there seems to be a shortage in number of job search coaches.",10/9/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],4.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy

It was pretty stressful during the program, but there is a ton of support if you are able/willing to put the time in. I had other  commitments outside of this class that I couldn't/didn't want to put on hold, which made it difficult to put in the time needed, but even with that I think it is doable. 

One other note: I think you need to somewhat enjoy coding to be able to get through it.

256099,2019.0,False,My App Academy experience,"In this review, I'm going to cover some general questions based on my experience with the App Academy online cohort.

1. Should you apply for a coding boot camp? I can't give you a straight answer for this because it depends on your situation. But in my case, it was worth it for me, since my goal was to learn about full-stack web development and software engineering to be as fast as possible. I think App Academy does a great job at that, and you will be surprised at how quickly you can learn here. It would have taken me far longer of self-studying to be where I'm at today. Not to mention, I've also made some great friends along the way that I talk to every day.

2. How should one prepare before applying to App Academy? I did the intro-to-programming section offered on https://www.aaonline.io and felt that I was ready to schedule a technical interview with AA. I was not, I failed my first interview and was lucky enough to get invited back for another. After failing, I realized that I needed much more practice. I practiced on https://www.codewars.com every day up until my next interview. You need to time yourself and talk out loud through the problem-solving process, preferably to a friend or family member. You should also be very comfortable working with arrays and hashes in Ruby and solving problems that may require nested loops. Sidenote: https://www.leetcode.com is another excellent place to practice. 

3. How many hours per week to get through the program? Like many have said before me, this boot camp is no joke. Even if you put in 80+ hours per week, you will only be scratching the surface of the topics covered. But this is the tradeoff of getting yourself job-ready as fast as possible.

4. How stressful is the program? If you have no programming experience, you will need to study hard to pass the six assessments. They cover Ruby algorithms, Ruby Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript. If you fail two of the assessment tests, you must retake one of their choosing. If you fail the retake test, you will be booted out. Yes, it's stressful, but keep your focus on the material and the great job that you're going to get out of it, and you'll be fine.

5. How is the curriculum? I think that some of the newer content at the end of the curriculum could use some improvement. But for the most part, it's fantastic. I know some people may be turned off by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but don't worry about it, you will also build full-stack applications with the MERN stack.

6. How are the instructors? From my experience, they were knowledgable and friendly. Leave the ego at the door and pick their brains as much as possible. They are a valuable resource. 

7. What is a day like at App Academy? At 8 AM we would meet on Zoom, the instructors would cover the daily material before splitting us up into random pairs to work on the day's projects. Throughout the day, we had access to the instructors to ask them questions. About an hour before the end of the day, we would all meet to cover the material in the day's project. Before the next day, we would then complete the assigned homework.

Even so, looking back I am amazed at how much I have learned and the things I can do now that I couldn't do before.

255811,2019.0,True,Challenging and Fun,"I am a software engineer with about 10+ years of experience and an MS in Computer Science so I expected to cruise through the boot-camp. Well, that did NOT happen!
What happened instead was that I learned a lot about Web-development ( not part of my work experience),  got challenged on a daily basis, had many frustrating times when I didn't 'get' what was being taught, but at the same time had a lot of fun. I also learned so much about 'soft skills' like building my Personal pitch, Resume, cover-letter etc...That part of curriculum is equally important (if not more) and it is a game-changer. No school or workplace teaches this, so if you get these right you have an unfair advantage over others.

I believe I had a unique vantage point in the sense that I was one of the few students who had software industry experience prior to app Academy. For people in my category -
   a) Check your ego at the door. app Academy picks really sharp people. You WILL be challenged, sometimes by people half your age. Don't resist it, embrace it for the learning experience it is.
   b) Get your stuff in order. The kids need to be sent to child-care. Household stuff needs to be delegated/outsourced. You will need to be there for every minute of the 9 hours of class and then some.

All in all a really positive experience and totally worth it.",9/30/2019,,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
255808,2019.0,False,App Academy was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life,"Coming from someone with zero experience, I was legitimately scared to even apply to App Academy. I came from a startup and knew what it was like to work nights and weekends so the hours that I was seeing (90-100 / week) in order to excel at aA wasn't too worrisome, but with no coding experience I thought there was a chance I'd fail out.

There's no sugarcoating it, if you apply to aA say goodbye to your social life, let your family know you won't see them for a couple months, and you probably have to cancel whatever plans you have lined up in the coming months. But it's worth it. I started in April, and my end date (when the job search STARTS) is October 4th. It's September 30th today and I'm enjoying my week off because I accepted an offer last week. I worked incredibly hard to be where I am right now, I began interviewing early after being reached out to by numerous companies and received an offer before the job search actually began. I'm INCREDIBLY confident had I not applied early I would be in the same position, as the career coaches and material were SPOT ON from what I saw in my interviews. I would have actually had more success had I waited to apply -- I was under-prepared for numerous roles, which would have been taken care of if I had waited -- so I have nothing but positive things to say about Eli and the entire job search portion.

There is no way of knowing whether or not you're made for this unless you go and do it, so give it a try. The only thing you have to lose is some time and maybe some sleep -- but you have an entire new life to gain. Financial independence, work / life balance, a fulfilling job and endless connections.

It was such a rewarding experience and I have learned many valuable things throughout the course. All of the TAs I have met were super friendly and highly knowledgable in the curriculum. If you're ever struggling (which I have been many a time), they take the time to sit with you and walk you through what you need help with. There is plenty of material for you to go through and study, and they also provide a lot of resources for you to use. By the end of the programming you're building your own websites by yourself and with a team. The satisfaction of creating your own functional website from scratch is very satisfying, kind of like the cherry on top of the program. If I could complain about one thing, it would probably be the amount of videos we had to watch during class on certain days. I feel like the in person cohort would have been better when it came to those days. However, that being said, my overall experience has been wonderful and I have learned so many things here at App Academy.",9/11/2019,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
254379,2019.0,True,Very Rewarding Experience,"App Academy is a fast-paced program for getting you practical experience with many different relevant technologies in a very short amount of time. Right off the bat once the immersive portion kicked into high gear, we got exposure to Git, data structures, and we were pair programming daily through the day’s projects. The curriculum is well structured for layering in new technologies, and before you know it you’re familiar with relational databases and doing a deep dive into the inner workings of Rails. Things move at a bewildering pace, and it’s very easy to get caught off guard by this early on if you’re not careful. 

The looming thought of getting kicked out over failing two assessments can be extremely unsettling, but this risk/reward setup also puts the entirety of the cohort into a hyper focused mindset. And it creates a unique environment for learning if you can sublimate the anxiety of it. Even through the online setup, it was surprising just how much there was a sense of community. You spend hours every day with your classmates, and even through a computer screen I felt like I got to know a lot of them really well. I don’t know how they’re able to isolate so many brilliant people into these cohorts, but they clearly have very efficient and calculated screening mechanisms in place to ensure they’re taking quality people into the program. 

The TA’s are fantastic. The student to teacher ratio is very favorable for student teacher interactions, and they were consistently pivotal in getting me on track with the material on pace to get through the assessments. It’s a lot of information so be 100% prepared to have no life while you’re working through the curriculum. I thought 100 hours a week would be an exaggeration but I was consistently logging 95-100 hours each week studying the material straight through the weekend. 

You get to build your own full stack project using the core stack of the curriculum, as well as other projects with additional technologies that you learn past the React portion of the course. They’re in a re-vamping phase with their curriculum with less of a focus on Ruby as far as I understand, so this is something to bear in mind moving forward. I’m confident that however they re-structure the curriculum will be just as effective as the current setup they have in place and I’m sure it’s necessary given the industry’s trending away from Rails, but any large scale overhaul of a curriculum carries with it at least some amount of risk. 

I felt like the React portion was great. Past that things were still mostly well structured with minor hiccups. There were portions I felt were too rushed. For example, we had about a weekend to learn the MERN stack before we were working in a team to build an application in it that following week. Pieces of this curriculum might need some revision. Maybe something as simple as having at least one additional project with the MERN stack before having students code in a team environment in it. However I really enjoyed the Docker portion of the curriculum, and it was fun building an additional project with GraphQL / Apollo. I’ve heard this part of the curriculum is at the moment isolated to the online setups. You get to build a project in Vanilla JavaScript at the end of the course as well. 

App Academy’s deferred payment plan was a strong draw for me personally. I felt that this established them as an institution willing to take on a lot of risk investing in the people they take into the program, and shows that they’re confident their curriculum will get people placed in well-paying positions upon finishing. I’d honestly like to see more institutions of higher education adopt a similar financing approach. There are pros and cons to deciding on doing the online setup instead of an in-person setup, and I do believe an in-person setup would have been very fulfilling. Some people would say the in person setup is vital to the whole App Academy experience. But I do like that the online setup at least had a longer space of time for absorbing the material. You get a month prior to the official immersive portion of the cohort to get solid with software engineering fundamentals. And the TA’s were always readily available to answer any questions I might have, so at least on the learning side there was nothing lost in translation going this route. An in person bootcamp really wasn’t feasible for me personally, and I would expect it’s not for many others planning on applying. 

All things considered the past 24 weeks have been a grueling yet highly rewarding experience. You get out of it what you put into it, and you have to put a lot into it if you want to get through the totality of the curriculum.",9/11/2019,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

253739,2019.0,True,Tough but rewarding way to get practical experience building modern web apps,"Before App Academy, I worked as a Developer to create training materials where the best part of my day was writing a couple lines of code to make the course look better. While I studied Computer Science briefly in college, I lacked the practical experience for building full stack modern web apps from scratch. App Academy was instrumental in giving me that experience and now I have four awesome projects I have added to my portfolio that I am truly proud of.

Do not underestimate the time you need to spend in order to succeed. I missed multiple important family events in order to ensure I passed the upcoming exams. Being EST time in the Online Cohort left me with virtually no free time during the day for myself since the day was from 11AM - 8PM. My life revolved around App Academy. However. I'd also like to stress that you're not alone. The TAs do an amazing job providing a support system and I would have felt comfortable at any point reaching out to them and telling them that I was overwhelmed. However, if I could go back and tell myself one thing it would be to trust the material because it helps you get where you need to be in order to succeed.

I always felt prepared for the exams. There were never any ""trick"" questions. I definitely felt that they wanted me to succeed, but as I stressed earlier, I prepared my butt off for them.

I felt not so positively about a few things. 
1. Towards one point in the curriculum, live lectures with your TAs got taken over by instructional videos. Even though we paused the videos to go over any questions, it was degrees of magnitude less engaging compared to when we were live doing it all together. 
2. As soon as we got into the Career Quest portion of the curriculum, things seemed to have derailed in terms of organization. Our TAs didn't seem to know what was on the schedule, especially towards the beginning of the Career Quest curriculum. 
3. Add a search functionality to the curriculum materials!! Especially during full stack projects, I needed to refer back to materials on how to do one specific thing and it was so difficult without a search. 
4. The strike system made me feel like I was back in elementary school and not trusted to handle my responsibilities. However, I can understand this necessary evil. :)

I joined the program last January (2019) and was part of the App Academy's first Online Cohort. We were a group of 8, spread across the US and even had a classmate living abroad, eating and sleeping on US Eastern time.

The program is very intense in terms of time commitment, where I spent every hour of the day and night studying (100hrs+ /week). But the more time I committed to study, the more I understood about each topic and learned. Each hour spent was worth it. 

If you really enjoy programming, you will love this program! You will have access to great TA/instructors, well-thought and detailed ressources. And learned all the skills you will need on the job.

Our initial cohort had Live Lectures from our instructor, where I was able to ask tons of questions to really understand very deeply each lecture. A minus point for future Online Cohorts, is that it may no longer be true as more recorded lectures started to get used right after our cohort. Even though, AA breaks it down so you can still ask questions every 45mins or hour. Staying engaged and awake while watching video lectures was never my strongest point. 

I have no regret though, the education was fantastic! Please give it a try and see whether it's for you!",8/6/2019,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
252896,2019.0,True,Pretty Good,"App Academy is a 3 months (5 if you're taking the online portion) web development boot camp with a very low acceptance rate.  The program is 8 hours of new materials everyday with 6 assessments  sprinkled in to test you.  The curriculum is pretty good for the most part and the projects you do a good job of testing what you learned for the day's material.  The peers you work with from the Teacher Ids to your peers are all great people to work with.

Some of the curriculum material could use an update/ be fleshed out better.",8/6/2019,Software Engineer Track: Online,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
252894,2019.0,True,"Tough, But Worth It","I'd been programming for several years and decided to do App Academy more as a ""formalization"" of my knowledge than as a way to ""learn to code"".  After all, I knew how to code.  Well, I was wrong.  I learned so much.   For example, a) The ""why"" behind many things I already knew how to do, thereby allowing for better decisions.  b) The practical value of data structures and algorithms I had previously written off as ""computer science stuff"", c) Effective pair programming - started out hating it, grew to love it.  d) A major raising of the bar in terms of what's possible - how about learning a new technology and using it to create something significant in 10 days?  If you have the tenacity to go after what you want, it's for you.

With no coding background experience, It was tough for me to understand and get the materials for the daily project.

253231,2019.0,True,App Academy,"What you get out of this program is really up to the student. The teaching staff is very knowledgeable about the subjects, but the subjects are a bit outdated.  A large portion of the curriculum is Ruby on Rails which is getting less and less popular, but it still does a good job of teaching you how to build full web applications. I think that the assessment based curriculum is good though because it gives stakes to the program. The rule is if you fail 2 tests, you get kicked out so the tests serve as a very good motivator to learn the material.",8/2/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
253203,2019.0,True,Amazing Staff - Curriculum Needs Some Work,"If you've read through even a few reviews for App Academy you're well aware that you're signing up for a serious grind. It bears repeating. For me, the biggest challenge early on was getting used to the sheer workload and still finding time for eating and sleeping. The first 8 weeks, be prepared to have new concepts thrown at you daily. Expect to spend 8 hours on campus working, and then at least 4-5 hours doing homework. In order to pass the periodic assessments, you'll also need to commit 10-12 hours a day on the weekends.

Once you're in the program, fight for your education! There is limited TA availability outside of when you're pair programming. While pairing, you have access to an ""Ask a Question"" feature within the online curriculum. After not making progress on any one task for more than 15 minutes, smash that button early and often. TAs have a knack for identifying issues and explaining concepts quickly, in a way that is easier to absorb than in the curriculum.

Pros:

Talented and knowledgeable TAs
Challenging curriculum that will push you to become a better programmer every single day
Pair programming teaches you how to effectively communicate your ideas and write better code
Projects you complete at the end of the curriculum will showcase just how much you've learned in 2-3 months
Cons:

The online curriculum starts out strong, but falters by the middle and end. Project instructions are at times frustratingly vague, and not written for the layman. There is very little linking between pages, and no search functionality. This is problematic when you need to revisit previously covered material for use in a current project
There are a ton of unnecessary chores that provide no value to the students (daily quizzes you aren't graded on, and aren't reviewed in class - daily feedback you must provide for your peers, but is never passed along to the you to act upon)
Assessments add a ton of stress and reward memorization more than programming concepts and techniques 
Facilities - San Francisco - The importance of ergonomics is stressed before you join, yet students work on stations with no monitor risers and no ability to make adjustments other than chair height. The 2014 Mac Minis sometimes struggle to even load Chrome or the code editor (be ready for the pinwheel of death). More bathrooms are needed (only two for over 150 people on the floor). There aren't enough utensils or microwaves.
Overall, App Academy proved to be the challenge that I signed up for. There's no way that I would've had the drive to learn as much as I did in the past three months if I had set out on my own. I'm also confident that the program positioned me well to find a job as a developer within the next few months.

That being said, App Academy still suffers from the same pitfalls that most for-profit post-secondary institutions do. At moments you'll feel cared for by individuals who are out to truly guide you in your education, and other times, you'll feel like you made a wrong turn.

If you're a self-starter, the whole curriculum is online - which is 100% what you'll be working off during you're time on-site pair-programming. If you have the drive, I'd recommend saving yourself the money and working online.",8/2/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],4.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy
253201,2019.0,True,Would Do This Again,"App Academy is an intense program, especially if you are doing the in-person course. Make sure you understand what you are signing up for. You can expect to spend at least 90 hours a week there and if you take your foot off the pedal during the program, it becomes really easy to fall into a vicious cycle of doom and gloom.

That being said, I enjoyed learning not only how to code in the leading languages and frameworks out there today but also how to develop a sense for different coding cultures found in industry. I also can't thank the instructors enough for their dedication and support. They go above and beyond to teach you the tools and mindset to succeed. I genuinely feel that everyone who makes it through the curriculum comes out with a sound foundation in all aspects of software engineering, from pair programming and debugging code to whiteboarding and solving algorithms. Not to mention that this will be the best opportunity to connect with and make lifelong friends in the industry.

One thing I do have to add is that a/A probably still has a lot of room to improve on both structuring the latter parts of the curriculum and stabilizing the volatility of the staff size from month to month. Unfortunately, our cohort had the pleasure of facing the peak of a staff shortage right as the regular curriculum ended, which I think curbed a lot of the momentum going into capstone projects.

All in all, this was undoubtedly the most rewarding learning experiences I've had. If a/A suddenly introduces an advanced-level course tomorrow, I would not hesitate to do this all again.",8/2/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

The support groups and lovely, caring TAs make the program what it is, but it's clear those in management only care about money. Not sure if they have reworked the curriculum well enough -future reviews will tell.

Also! The punitive strike system is ridiculous. It only adds stress and puts more pressure on people who are most dedicated and self-sufficient.",8/2/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,2.7,[],3.0,2.0,3.0,app-academy

253083,2019.0,True,Great experience,"I enrolled the last 12 weeks intensive bootcamp program at App Academy. Apparently they are changing the cohort to 16 weeks from now on.

Overall, App Academy is not the place where you just sit there and hoping someone would hold your hand to review through programming related materials. Sure, there is help provided if you request so, but it definitely takes effort and dedication to be successful at App Academy, and more importantly, to be successful at your future job after graduation. Self-motivation is the key to success here.

Even though I came from software developer background, the topics that App Academy taught us are pretty challenging, that I constantly find myself running out of time to study ahead of next day's material. Though, I did feel fulfilled and satisfied by the overwhelming topics that we have to read and understand because it is also probably one of the few way we could improve ourselves rapidly. 

My only suggestion to future students are: do not slack off during the weekend. I learned that the hard way...",7/31/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

You should have good work ethic, you basically have to clear your calendar for 3 months dedicated to it (including holidays).The tests are a mixed bag. They can be very hard and feel somewhat contrieved. But in all honesty if you study for them you can not help but learn the material.

I was doubtful at first about pair programming. It seemed to me just a way to offload the workload of teaching a student by having other students teach each other. I wondered how much can I learn off someone who doesn't know any more than me? Or how useful can I be to someone else when I have no idea what is going on? But what actually happens is both of you work through a problem together. There are times when know/understand something better and are forced to explain that. That process of having to explain  your though process is invaluable. It cements your undersand and proves that you know what you are talking about. 

All in all it was a good experience. For best results take it seriously and study before hand. Its insanely fast paced. I doubt how sucessful you can be if you come in to it blind.",7/31/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.5,[],4.0,3.0,,app-academy
253078,2019.0,True,"Intense, Scary, Overwhelming and WORTH IT!","Before deciding to attend a bootcamp, I did the same thing you are doing.  I read review after review, trying to gauge the value a program like this one might offer me.  My previous experience with coding was a grand total of one Intro to C++ class at a local community college, and a few of UC Berkeley's online Software Development Certificate classes (none of which I personally recommend, but that's a story for another day).  Once I had decided that the bootcamp path was one I would take, I began the arduous task of selecting the RIGHT bootcamp.  Ultimately, I decided that an in-person program was the right fit for my learning style.  Living in the SF Bay Area, there seemed to be two choices.  I asked friends and family, that work in the tech industry, to take a look at the syllabi, read all the reviews, and had a few sleepless nights.  I ultimately chose App Academy as the school I wanted to attend, participated in their online bootcamp prep program, and a few months later I was rewarded with acceptance into their program.  Then the really difficult part began . . . 

     This program is intense, it's designed that way and they make no apologies about it.  You are forced to constantly learn new material, never truly feeling comfortable before the next topic is laid before you.  A week into the course, I was sure that I would not make it.  I came home everyday to my wife and told her that I had no idea what was going on, that I was barely hanging on, that many other people surely had a better grasp of the material and I was doomed.  I spent hours each day after class and every weekend up at the school, working on homework or studying for assessments.  App Academy is quick to point out that almost everyone has these feelings, and it's Imposter Syndrome in full effect.  They chose you for a reason, they say.  You are supposed to be here.  For myself, these feelings of inadequacy continued through the course.  Though you do get comfortable with a general feeling of unease and helplessness.  I will also say, that despite these feelings, I did feel supported throughout the program.  I could ask questions whenever I wanted, help was available from TAs and my fellow students.  The bonds formed in this stressful situation, and the assistance that you are able to both receive and give to those around you helps keep you grounded and headed towards the finish line.  I've heard a lot of talk about the structure of Assessments, and the policy of being asked to leave if you fail 2 of them.  Is the system perfect?  No, it is not.  Is fear an amazing motivator?  Yes, it certainly is.  Is watching good, hardworking, smart people walk out the doors early a painful experience?  Without a doubt.  Is there a better way to do it?  I truly don't know.  But that is the process that App Academy has chosen, so just know what you are getting into.  If you are not able to calm yourself down in extremely stressful testing situations, these tests are going to be hard.  But, if you do the work, if you go over the practice tests and make attempts to understand the material to the best of your ability, if you are honest with yourself about the information you do not understand and ask questions, you will be fine.  If I made it through, you can too.

     As I write this, I am at the end of the program, with just a few days left.  The Job Search part of the program is much different than the instructional portion.  There is much less structure, the occasional lecture on soft skills, networking, reumés, interviewing questions, and further work on some algorithms and data structures.  Some people enjoy this portion, some hate it.  Some feel abandoned, some use it to finally focus on what they really find interesting.  I don't really have any issues with it.  I'm happy to be provided with the school's perspective on how to get a job in a very competitive industry, but the quick switch from an extremely structured environment to one where you drive the process can have one feeling lonely.  In the end though, you are the only one responsible for your career and you have to start providing yourself with motivation and guidance at some point in time.

      Overall, I can honestly say that I would make the decision to come back to App Academy again.   I have learned invaluable skills, and I have a path to a job doing something that I love.  There is still a lot of work left to do.  I will have to go back and dive deeper into nearly all of the concepts covered in the course.  I don't believe that most people come out able to get a job the next day, but I would never have made the progress that I did without the rigor and stress that came along with the program.  The bootcamp experience is definitely not for everyone.  But if you do chose to take this path, I believe that you will find it very rewarding.  As others have stated, and in the interest of full disclosure, I am being offered a sweatshirt as motivation for writing a review.  I believe everything that I have written, and it is my honest assessment of the program and my experience in it.

253069,2019.0,True,Great positive and friendly learning environment.,"Overall, I had a great time during the 12-week in-person curriculum. While I did come in with an undergraduate CS degree, I feel that the material supplemented what I learned in college quite well (although a bit slow the first few weeks). But given my background, I did not find the pacing of the course to be all that intensive until the projects hit. There is definitely plenty to learn. They go in-depth enough on topics necessary to be considered a web developer but there are a lot of topics only briefly touched on to explore further on your own.

Pros:
 - TAs are extremely friendly and willing to help
 - Plenty of interesting projects to work on throughout the course
 - Pretty much everybody was fun and easy to work with

Cons:
 - Trying to get help during projects can lead to a lot of waiting for TAs
 - Homework could be more meaningful rather than a bunch of small segmented assignments

253059,2019.0,True,An incredibly rewarding experience with plenty of room for improvement,"PROS:
Exceptional classmates --> First and foremost, I have to recognize how lucky I was to have such an amazing cohort. The degree of talent in the room, the relentless work ethic, the shared positivity, and the fun! I'm very thankful for the lasting connections I've forged throughout the curriculum.

Rewarding projects --> I dare say you'll work harder than you've ever worked in your life when approaching your solo / group full-stack projects in the back-half of the curriculum. If you take the projects seriously and approach them as learning experiences, you will 100% grow as a person and as a software developer.

Knowledgeable teaching assistants --> I was fortunate to have an extremely knowledgeable and passionate TA as my circle leader; he consistently did a terrific job of reinforcing the learnings from the curriculum and ensuring that we felt prepared heading into our assessments. The rest of the TAs, some more experienced than others, did a fine job of designing/delivering our daily lectures as well as helping us all out on the floor each afternoon while we tackled our pair-programming assignments. 

CONS:
Absence of Feedback --> As a new student, you'll be required to provide daily feedback on a  variety of topics: quality of the curriculum, how well your pair-programming experiences go, your satisfaction level related to the support of your TAs, etc... and yet (to my knowledge) none of us ever received a single piece of feedback in return. I was very vocal about my desire for someone with experience to review my code or even my progress at any point in the curriculum... sadly, this did not come to fruition. If I'm honest, App Academy did not faithfully deliver on the expectations it set regarding the amount of support we would receive throughout the program. There were times when I was either seriously concerned about my own performance or extremely frustrated with aspects of the curriculum, but no one representing the program ever extended an opportunity to have a conversation about this.
 
Excessive emphasis on passing assessments --> Expect to take tests constantly (at least 1x / week for the first six weeks, not including practice exams). As of this moment, if you fail more than 2 exams, you risk getting dismissed from the program. The pressure was extremely high for almost all of us leading up to the assessments; we were concerned for ourselves and the possibility of losing the friends that we became close with. While I don't have a problem with designing a system to ensure that students are keeping up with the course material, I do seriously question each test's ability to accurately (or even roughly) gauge a student's understanding of the material. In hindsight, it felt like a lot of success was derived from a combination of memorizing code and test-taking strategies that were aimed to prioritize passing unit tests (i.e. scoring points) over genuine understanding of the course material... this last point being especially frustrating because it lies in direct contrast to App Academy's emphasis on prioritizing understanding over finishing assignments / projects. 

Poorly designed online educational materials --> Over time, I found myself increasingly frustrated by the quality of App Academy's online educational materials. As a full-time in-person student, you will rely on this online program to supplement the daily lectures and help you complete the daily homework assignments. As a visual / tactile learner, I have no problem admitting that I regularly found myself completely discouraged by App Academy's approach to online learning: giant blocks of dense (often highly technical) text, static (non-interactive) code-snippets, poorly edited videos with outdated material, UI that lacks search functionality, etc... and you'll frequently find topics that App Academy decides to send you elsewhere on the Internet to learn about. 

HTML / CSS education needs (a lot of ) love --> I would not recommend App Academy's HTML / CSS education above any of the most well-known and freely available resources on the internet. The curriculum peppers in bite-size doses of these topics with several half-hour projects & only 1 lecture entirely devoted to CSS. Almost all of us reached intermediate levels of competency in these topics exclusively through self-learning while working on our full-stack projects.

Insufficient guidance --> This criticism is specific to the back-half of the curriculum, when you'll transition to working on projects and preparing for your inevitable job search. Some examples come to mind: the shortage of TAs to support our cohort and the lack of organization / awareness / preparation regarding project-related lectures & availability of related online resources. I would also recommend regular check-ins between coaches and students in either a small group setting or 1 on 1 (if time permits); the program can often feel like such a whirlwind and the burden is so often laid on the backs of the students to figure things out themselves... I can't speak for everyone, but I would feel SO much better at least having the perception that there's someone here that is willing to actively guide me instead of just passively being available in the shadows. 

Final Thoughts:
Though this opinion is subject to change once I leave the program and make my way through the job search... despite all my criticisms (no bootcamp is perfect), I have ZERO regrets about enrolling in this program. It challenged me to grow in ways I have never experienced in an academic or professional setting. It gifted me some amazing new friendships and connections that I'm extremely grateful to walk away with. It's worth noting that bootcamps are absolutely not made for everyone... the firehosing of information, the lack of sleep, the pressure, the impostor syndrome... this can often feel like an extremely stressful environment (on your body and your mind)... but if you're up for the challenge, this could very well change your life.",7/31/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],4.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy

252993,2019.0,True,Worth It,"Simply put: App Academy was worth my time and effort (and it requires both in huge quantities).  I do have specific issues with the program, but as you attempt to weigh those against the first sentence, remember that no bootcamp, no undergrad, no educational program will ever be perfect.  You know the old adage 'you get out what you put in?' App Academy will absolutely convert your effort into the desired result.

One piece of advice that I don't think is specific to App Academy:  only compare yourself to yourself.  I guarantee there will plenty of people who seem smarter or better at everything.  Ignore them.  Only you know if you're putting in the time, if you're staying engaged throughout the day, if you're holding yourself accountable to be the best that you can be.  Do your best and the rest will take care of itself.

PROS:
 - The staff - the TAs (catchall term for instructors) are uniformly knowledgeable and excited to teach.  Nearly every lecture was well presented, well communicated, and directly relevant to the material.
 - The material - the curriculum is rigorous and challenging.  Many of the projects that we struggled through in the first weeks will make valuable portfolio additions when we go back and attack them with everything we've learned.  
  The rhythm for most of the curriculum section is learn material - > assessment -> pivot to new material.  This can give you a feeling of whiplash, but what remains constant is the idea that you 'always be learning.'  I feel much better equipped to learn new things in a short period of time than I think I would have had the transitions been more gradual and forgiving.
 - General culture - For 12 weeks the fellow students in your cohort will be your allies both in learning and life.  Nobody else will really understand what it's like to go through the program.  This might be specific to my cohort, but from what I've seen of other cohorts the sentiment holds true.  Beyond that though, the general culture, the interaction between students and students, students and staff, and aA employee culture are all just really positive, really goal oriented and at the same time really forgiving.
 - Project phase - After the curriculum, you'll work on projects.  Working on full stack projects was just a fantastic way to tie together all the things we'd spent the last 8 weeks learning.  There is, however, a somewhat stark drop off in how much help you'll get from staff from the course curriculum phase to the project phase.

CONS:
  Feedback void - Every day you'll be required to give feedback on your partner for the day, and several times throughout the course you'll be asked for feedback on the experience as a whole.  At no point was I given any indication that my feedback was considered.  Several times throughout the course I specifically asked to hear the general sentiment of feedback people were leaving about me, and I got no response (beyond 'yes we can do that' but then nothing).  To be clear, I do believe that feedback I left was at least read by human eyes, but that's just a hunch because again, communication was an entirely one way street of me to anonymous form.
 Further, beyond assessments testing basic functionality of your code, there is no feedback around code style, code smell, or overall code practices.  The code we're exposed to in the project skeletons and demo is generally good and tightly written, but there's no checking to see if any of that has sunk in.  I was particularly disappointed by this because on day 1 a TA made a point of saying that aA graduates write more readable, cleaner code than CS graduates, but then there was just no system in place to ensure that.
As far as I know no human ever evaluated the quality of my code.  Maybe the lesson there is, 'if it works, it works' but that seems short sighted and not in keeping with the idea of producing quality software developers.

I'm resisting leaving feedback on the job search section because I'm in the middle of it now.  That said, thus far we've covered basic algorithms and data structure in greater depth than we did during the curriculum.  We've worked on our resumes, our personal pitch, and what to expect from the whole process.  I think I won't know the true value of the job search support until some time after the program.

PS I did a fair amount of research into various bootcamps before I decided on aA.  Obviously my experience is limited to the one I choose, but investigated Hack Reactor, General Assembly, and Berkeley Boot camp in addition to aA.  Of those, only Hack Reactor seemed up to the same level as aA.",7/29/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.5,[],5.0,4.0,,app-academy
252987,2019.0,True,Tough but worth it. Know what you're getting into.,"I'd say overall App Academy is one of the best decisions I've ever made and one of the hardest things I've ever done. A few things that have been mentioned to me that ring true: 

""Its kinda like having a firehose of information pointed at you, and you just do your best to drink up as much as you can"" 

There's also feeling that it really is a bootcamp of sorts. If you think about the traditional military bootcamps, there's a sense of discipline instilled in you in the process, and you walk out with friendships and bonds built from going through a difficult experience together. You can't get through this program alone. You'll need the support of the people around you and your classmates to really succeed, and as a result you'll end up with a strong network of very capable developers along with the skills you actually pick up here. 

You get as much out of this as you put in. Don't come in expecting to have your hand held. Don't come in expecting everyone you're learning from to be perfect and know everything.

The curriculum is designed so that students will never feel comfortable or relaxed.  There will always be something to work on.  Students are mostly forced to move on to the next material regardless of finishing the current project.  That being said, students have to use their own time to go back to the materials that they are unclear about.  This can be overwhelming and exhausting.

I have never worked harder in my life than in the past 12 weeks that I have been here, but more importantly I felt fulfilled while working.

App Academy has misled on its placement rates - used to say 99%, then 95%, and on their website they even state, only 2% of graduates don't find a job. A/A is slippery with their wording - in 2017 (the latest year of published data), it was 64% - which doesn't even show the number of grads that made far far less than $100k a year.  Those placement rates are deceptive. I think it's irresponsible to present the odds of success as so unrealistically high to hopeful career changers. App Academy is one of the few schools that still is publishing these kinds of incredibly... generous interpretations of their placement stats after Flatiron School got hit with a 300k fine and big publicity hit for similarly deceptive advertising.

What is the percentage of students who fail to comply with the terms of the job search agreement by not choosing to spend an entire year job searching full time?

What's the placement rate at three months, at six months? Including the possibility of being ejected with a partial refund from the cohort due to underperformance, you're looking at slightly worse than Vegas odds for having a job after enrolling in App Academy in less time than it takes a baby.

Job seekers are not allowed to hold any non-tech jobs while residing in SF or NYC, are required to send a minimum of 40 job applications a week & can be forced to come in 9-5 to the spartan app academy offices to engage in job search activities. Around 6% actually abide by these restrictions with no income coming in and are demonstrably unemployed for the full year, but lots of students are included in the list of those who haven't 'abided by the course rules' because they needed to work to make SF rent and get caught when tax records get pulled...

App Academy students are largely brilliant. People do get six-figure jobs, especially those with STEM backgrounds who would have found their way there with or without a boot camp.
But there are a lot of people failing to clear the bar in an increasingly competitive market with cookie-cutter portfolios who are silenced with NDA's that are a part of the offboarding paperwork & covered up with cherry-picked statistics.

The most intensive part of the curriculum is keeping up with the schedule. The material by itself is structured to teach a student from the ground up. The challenging portion is for the student to maintain studying priorities, time management, and health. If a student can do these things well, then the student will be able to pick up everything needed to pass the program.

250513,2019.0,True,Grueling but absolutely worth it!,"I feel like I could write a novel on my time at App Academy, but I'll try to be brief. Without question, a/A was the most intellectually stimulating, intense, and overwhelming experience I've ever been a part of. If you're only reading this review because you heard elsewhere that the curriculum requires about 90+ hours of work per week and you're just trying to ascertain whether it's even possible to work that much, you can stop reading here. It is absolutely in that ballpark. Of course, it's different for everyone and some topics will come easier to some folks. I didn't find that I was spending 90 hours every single week, but the time really begins to add up quickly between the 45-minute commute there, morning lecture time from 9 AM - 12:15 PM, afternoon pair programming from 1:30 PM to 6 PM, another 45-minute commute home, and then any required readings, videos, and homework for the following day's material which could often take up to 3 or 4 hours. All of that happens 5 days a week, with no holidays or time off. It also wasn't completely unheard of for members of my cohort to be in about an hour early or to work through lunch in order to solidify some of the concepts.

I can say that I WAS able to carve out a little time on the weekends to maintain my sanity, but for at least the first half of the curriculum (when assessments are on Mondays) every minute you spend on the weekend not studying is just going to fill you with a combination of guilt and dread on top of the stress already placed on you by the rigor of the course. As other reviews have mentioned, the assessments are not easy but they are always very fair. It is definitely not subjective in any way and assessments are graded solely based on how many test specs you can get to pass before time runs out. The quantity of material you need to know for any individual test is large and studying will sometimes feel insurmountable. However, it is absolutely possible for every person in the cohort to get a perfect score since the tests are not designed to trick you or test you on something you weren't explicitly told to study for.

Anyone who isn't scared off by the absolutely massive scale of the curriculum and the short timeframe you're afforded to cram it all into your brain in a useable way will be rewarded with an incredible toolkit and the confidence to apply for any software developer job. I'm in the middle of my job search currently and I'm applying to tons of stuff, including and especially jobs that work on a different stack than App Academy teaches, strictly because I am now confident that there is nothing I can't teach myself using the skills I gained at a/A.

Lastly, I can't say enough good things about the Teaching Assistants at a/A. They are super knowledgeable, great at debugging (as they likely see similar issues from cohort to cohort), and are genuinely invested in your success. I asked for help often and was never made to feel inferior or bad about it in any way.

I went to App Academy looking to learn a new skill and shift my career towards software engineering. Below is my  experience of the course.

Pros:
- Large amount of materials, everyday is a new topic. They make you learn continuously with time practice and put concepts into use.
- Staffs are supportive and helpful. Staffs are always there to answer a technical question or to talk about other issues like handling stress. Most staffs have gone through the course and have great ways/tips to help jiggle all the different tasks.
- Lots of pair programming. Gives the opportunity to work with different people and to practice talking about programming and explaining things in easy to understand ways.

Cons:
- Tons of work. In addition to lecture/pair programming during the day, there are hours of work on most nights like readings, homework and reviewing the day's solutions. There is really no time to do anything besides learning.
- Stressful, physically and mentally. It can be difficult to get enough sleep trying to keep up with the program. Also, it's rare to completely finish a day's problems during the day, so there's always the pressure of falling behind.

From start to finish, everything that App Academy teaches you is a needed skill in the tech industry.  For example something that might be overlooked is pair programming.

250783,2019.0,True,App Academy - The Experience,"Scroll through the other reviews, but stop Here.

App Academy is hard, they tell you about not knowing the difficulty and it’s kind of true, the problem is the exams get longer and your more at risk of being behind so probably on average it does get harder.  I don’t know why they say that but it’s probably rooted at the top level.  This is what you need to know.

To get into App Academy it will be pretty hard to just apply and pray...you need to Study.  If you do study than look for the app academy problems online or go on GitHub(entry level) and search for them.  Jumpstart can help if your background is weak(only couple months), but I certainly noticed an edge for those who did Boot Camp Prep(I didn’t and I was a little envious).   

So who Am I ?  Well I just graduated Today...take my review with respect to that aspect of App Academy’s curriculum.  Reviewing them is a little tough because everyone is different, some people pick it up faster(I’m diligent so it’s at what I call a normal pace) and others pick it up faster, but those people which will be in Your cohort have some type of strong technical background most likely.  The tests are hard and it is true you can’t tell which one is the hardest normally due to the differences in people.  They will overwork you on purpose and try to see if you can pass because if you can’t they want you to fail out.  Part of the reason is the last ten days of the main part of the curriculum they let you work on the full stack, but it’s an extremely expensive operation and probably not profitable for them if you can’t do the basics of coding.  Not to mention once you start the Full Stack project you need to be able to do it mostly on your own so you can put it on your Resume and say “I did that.”  

The best part?  The Teacher assistants without a doubt.  I was actually surprised at home many there are(around six plus the main instructor).  The teacher assistants are highly skilled and during the course you will likely learn the most from them more than anything else. 

When you put it all together App Academy’s program is very good and costs quite a bit of capital to run, remember these teacher assistants are paid well.   

A couple of last notes.  They are now like a well oiled machine.  They hire in advance, train the next leaders before they leave, prep the next cohort as soon as you start yours, and they do not stop for whatever reason.....in App academy there are no days off and they work through almost all holidays.   

If you want to go to App Academy I recommend it.  Better if you can pair it with a degree, but standalone it’s good too.  If I was you and you were accepted I would not hangout on the weekends. I went to a wedding one day and felt behind the entire course because of it.  There’s so much homework that catching up is really hard and the weekends are for studying the tests since it’s pointless to do the homework if you can’t pass the test.  Overall four  stars because of the lack of support for stressed out individuals.  They say talk to us,  but it’s not very inviting and I took it as a clue for an opportunity for them to say to you “this course is not for everyone.”",6/28/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

251466,2019.0,True,Challenging but Rewarding Experience,"This was probably one of the toughest 12+ weeks of my life. 

Everyday was a grind and a struggle. Oftentimes I felt like I was suffocating with the amount of work and hours needed to stay afloat with the program. The near-weekly assessments were constant pressures to keep going. Everyone else around you seems to have a much better grasp of concepts than you do, and just ""smarter"" than you in terms of coding ability. 

But, despite all of that, it was an extremely rewarding experience that I would definitely recommend. The difficulty of the program helps you cope in any situation afterwards no matter the circumstances. You're working with some of the smartest people around (you included), and you're able to learn and grow accordingly.

I came with a non-technical background and only started to prepare 3 months before the cohort started. So, I had a hard time going through the program but it was also one of the most rewarding experience I have ever had challenging myself mentally, physically, and intellectually. I joined the program alone and came out of it with a massive network and close friends who will always be there to support me in engineering career.

The curriculum is intense and that intensity means you learn a lot more quickly than you would learn on your own. I personally found it super important for getting me started with no prior technical experience. They even have a free two-week prep program to help you pass the entrance exam. In addition, the TAs are friendly and willing to sit and be patient to figure things out with you. That said, the first 4.5 weeks of the program focuses on a language and a framework that is in decline. Ruby and Rails are decreasing in popularity and so it sometimes felt like a lost opportunity that we spent so much time on them. The subsequent 4.5 weeks were focused on JavaScript and React/Redux, however, and these are much more currently in demand. The tuition guarantee was a huge positive for me as I likely wouldn't have done a bootcamp otherwise. My caution would be that App Academy seems to be in a transitional phase of updating their curriculum and so it might be more in date in the near future.

251375,2019.0,True,AA Full Stack In Person,"Full disclosure: AppAcademy promised my a hoodie for this review.

As we took the program, every week aA has asked from 1-10 how likely we would be 
to recommend it to a friend. Every week I have answered 10/10, and I still would.

I came to aA after having studied CS formally, as well as having a lot of experience
working as a developer in the past, just looking to reskill to keep up with the
industry. This is not the story for most students, and you certainly don't need 
prior experience to succeed, although you will probably have to put in more effort 
before-hand to ensure you understand the basics.

AA is as difficult as everyone says. I have probably spent 100-120 hours working
on material every week since the program started to keep up with the readings.
Expect to spend every waking minute once you start doing nothing but studying or 
coding. Your life will be AA; it is a bootcamp after all. No nights, no weekends,
no holidays (we were expected to come in Memorial day).

You will come out of this knowing how to develop a full stack application, as well
as have a portfolio of several projects to show an employer. You will learn a few
basic CS concepts (a very small introduction to DS/A), but without college experience
you will probably need to spend a bit of time doing additional independent study
after the cohort, during interview prep. Compared to a college degree where you will
learn more of the academic CS concepts, but have a lot less to actually show.

You will also get through this much faster, and cheaper, than going for a four year degree.
I personally feel that actually being able to build a real app, something a lot of college
curricula spend too little time focusing on, is a huge advantage over traditional study.

There are a few negatives. Most of the project work you complete before your fullstack
project will not actually be usable for portfolios, although it will teach you a lot.
You will not always get a good pair, although almost everyone you work with will become
your closest friends for the next 12 weeks. There are also some policies that could use
some reworking. Prior to my application, it was not clear that the program also had a
preliminary ""foundations"" course, four weeks of self directed study to prep for the
program (which you absolutely need to do if you don't have experience!! make sure you
are comfortable with this material on day 1 of in person), and this could have been 
made more transparent prior to applying. Some of the material is a bit outdated, which
is expected given how fast technologies evolve and new versions come out. The curricula 
is constantly under development, but some aspects may lag slightly behind.

I still say, given the choice between this and a CS degree, this will be more useful to
you practically, as you will actually be building real applications in what is equivalent
to less than a semester of college. AA is extremely prestigious, and I would not have
decided to come here if I wasn't going to be proud to include it on my Resume.",5/30/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

251354,2019.0,True,One of many coding bootcamps...,"Disclaimer: Being compensated with a hoodie on graduation for this review.

App Academy has a 12 week intensive bootcamp program to prepare people for fullstack web development. It is a bootcamp (read: fast-paced and intensive), and will take up your life for the entire time you're there until you get a job. The TAs and lecturers are all students from prior cohorts so they have experienced what you will be going through, but they are software engineers at heart as well. The culture is great, and the pair programming experience is a fantastic way to develop your collaboration skills.

That being said, it is a bootcamp, and not for everyone. I've personally spent about 10-12 hours daily on campus, the majority of the time studying/working on projects. The curriculum is fast paced and rigorous, and you will live assessment by assessment. The Ruby curriculum is much better than the JavaScript curriculum, despite JavaScript being the more popular language by far. The time allocated for the three major projects seemed too restricting, despite the repeated emphasis of the importance of team projects. On top of that, the JavaScript curriculum is taught as ES6, but most of the resources given are for ES4 and ES5.

The curriculum spends time covering concepts but also requires projects to rebuild the concept so that your understanding goes into what is occurring behind the scenes and not just the use behind it. A lot of effort is placed to provide students the resources required to learn the material, either staying late or volunteering their time over the weekends when students can come in to study. While I still have things to learn before I probably will be hired full time, aA provided me all the tools and skills necessary to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer!",5/28/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
251344,2019.0,True,Test Your Might,"There are many positive things about App Academy. I will begin by saying that the program is absolutely as rigorous as it is advertised to be. That said, you will certainly get out of it what you put in, and the opportunity to learn a great deal in a very short amount of time is certainly, at least to an extent, dependent upon how much effort and time you are able to put in. For me, App Academy was certainly a life changing experience, and I would do it all over again if I had to. But the reality is that it is not for everyone, and the demanding curriculum and constant threat of being expelled are important considerations for anyone thinking about taking the dive with a/A.

I can confidently say that the first few weeks of the curriculum are very well organized. While the pace is aggressive, the structure is easy to follow, and the TAs are an invaluable resource. A majority of the day is spent pair programming with other members of your cohort, and asking questions is probably the primary way that you will learn the material. You quickly move from Ruby, to SQL, and on to Rails, before you run into something of a slowdown with the Javascript curriculum. Once you enter the land of JS, the instruction on projects becomes muddled, at times lacking, and is often just flat outdated. I understand that a shift away from Rails to more relevant frameworks and libraries will be a process. But it is unfortunate.

I will close by stressing that if you decide to take the leap and attend a/A, be ready to put everything else on the back burner. You will be tested and pushed to your limits often, but if you are able to meet the demands, then it can be a truly rewarding experience.",5/28/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

First I will start off with the cons: There isn't really anything for emotional or mental support here at app academy. I understand that maybe it is not part of the mission of the academy but I feel the students would be able to perform better if either there was a dedicated psychologist on staff or if the TA's received some kind of support training.

251481,2019.0,True,It's really what you make out of it.,"Yes, it's a demanding experience - that's a given. But, the App Academy experience is really what you make out of it. There is an abundance of content, and knowledgeable instructors. But, if you don't genuinely engage in the material daily, or deliberately ask the instructors for help, then you will not learn as much as others who proactively ask questions and challenge themselves. The instructors will never hold your hand, or give you an easy way out. Rather, they will train you to learn how to learn, so that you may become an independent programmer and thinker. 

If you have a basket that holds 5 apples, App Academy will throw 10 apples at you every week. Accordingly, you will have to drop 5 apples every week, and choose which 5 you will digest. This can feel overwhelming at first, but that's just how the curriculum is designed. The assessments keep you on track, but they are definitely not the perfect system - and the instructors also agree with this. If you fail 2 exams, you will be kicked out. Accordingly, if you fail one exam, you will constantly be in a stressed and anxious state throughout the program, and I can't imagine that being too great for your health. But as for the moment, assessments get the job done.

Overall, I've learned a ton through the program, and became a disciplined individual and developer. My expectations were not met, but I am definitely a better developer today than I was before the start of the program.

247531,2018.0,True,"App Academy is great, but the market ain't what it used to be","All the usual disclaimers: these opinions are solely my own, etc. I went through App Academy in the October 2018 cohort. Though I ended up with a job I'm thrilled with ~2 months after graduation, the following is information I wish I had known going in.

App Academy's curriculum is first-class. Though it's now freely available online, I found that working through the material in-person with instructor and peer support allowed me to work way harder and learn 100X more effectively than if I had done it on my own. There are a few minor nits to pick with the curriculum (my two cents: not enough vanilla Javascript and React without Redux, too much into to programming stuff), but the staff is incredibly receptive to feedback and changes requested by my cohort are already being implemented in subsequent cohorts. 

I initially disliked the pair-programming part of the program, but I came around after a few weeks. I do think forcing yourself to communicate your thoughts is the best way to learn and avoid tricking your brain into thinking you know something you don't. Though it's exhausting to do this all day every day, especially if you're an introvert. 

The rigor of the program is well-documented in other reviews, although I found this pace fun rather than stressful. I devoted ~80 hours a week on average to the program, up to ~100 on intense project weeks. Though controversial, I personally like the assessments as part of the curriculum. I found they kept the pace moving and incentivized learning quite well. Overall,  I had an absolute blast during the coding portion of a/A. 

One thing that's critical to note is that most of these reviews were written after completing the coding portion of the curriculum (week 9), but before the job search curriculum (weeks 10-12) or the actual job search. At that point I would have been similarly enthusiastic, but I think most of the negatives of App Academy surface after week 9.

The job search curriculum attempted to balance 2 more projects (one with a totally new tech stack), a primer on algorithms and data structures, behavioral preparation, and application materials (resumes etc.). In my opinion, all of these missed the mark. The MERN stack and algorithms projects/lectures were perfunctory and insufficient. The non-technical portions were mainly common sense to anyone who has been through an interview process before (though there are students at a/A who haven't, so this material may have been helpful to them). On top of this, all of these disparate pieces were done in parallel, making it impossible to focus on any of them. I think doing them serially would have been far more effective.

As difficult as the program is, the job search afterwards is 1000X harder. Though demand for developers is as high as ever, demand for junior developers seems to have taken a nosedive over the past few years. Entry-level dev jobs are hard to come by, and competition for them is fierce due to the high volume of cookie-cutter bootcamp grads out there. App Academy offers guidance on how to navigate this tough market, but it feels like an arms race and I have serious doubts about how long a/A will be able to keep its stats where they are. 

It's also not really accurate to consider this a 12-week program. Though instruction only lasts for 12 weeks, most students will need to spend significant time self-studying (JS  and web for frontend, algorithms and data structures for backend and fullstack). In my opinion a/A's 12 weeks are plenty sufficient to become a competent junior developer, but the reality of the job market right now is that you will likely have to go well beyond this to get hired, even if you're a top performer in the program.

A few things I wish I'd known about placements: The vast majority of App Academy grads end up at startups. Students do get placed at bigger companies occasionally, but this is uncommon. Students with work histories, degrees, and demographics more aligned with industry demand will, in general, have an easier time finding jobs, though counterexamples do exist. Salaries seem to be more or less as advertised. I expected more out of a/A in terms of pipelines and company partnerships - they do have a few (<5) and are working on more, but expect to do almost all of the heavy lifting yourself.

Note that many of these issues are not necessarily unique to a/A but are present across the bootcamp industry. Though a/A's job search curriculum could use some work and the job search is infinitely more difficult than advertised, I had an absolute blast going through App Academy and ended up with an offer I am thrilled with.

There are many instances where the program teaches students the ""under the hood"" workings of some built in function or program so that you understand the base functionality before moving on to actually using the tools themselves to do the hard part. Essentially, my point is that it's very in-depth and the TAs (teaching assistants) are very supportive as well, providing daily lectures and answering any questions students might have as they work on their projects throughout the week. The only complaint I really had was the homework. The homework is optional but it's a good idea to do it as often as one can so as to enter the following day with a good grasp of the material that will follow. It is, however, very frustrating, oftentimes with vague directions and few satisfactory results. It's very difficult to end a full day of coding with homework on new material that isn't always explained very effectively. I personally skipped many days of homework just so I could go to sleep with some peace of mind rather than feeling frustrated and stressed. At the very least, I did always do the readings and videos that were assigned. The other thing I would mention is that this is mostly a learning by doing type of curriculum. Different learning styles aren't really taken into account here. There are lectures and readings, but primarily, coding is hands-on material and there's no way around that. Students should definitely  expect to put in 80 hours a week (including the 45 hours that one must be in attendance) minimum during this bootcamp if they want to succeed. If one puts in the time and devotion for the full 10 weeks, then they will be web developers and they will find a job, plain and simple.

Some warnings though, the program is no joke. You'll be spending around 100 hours a week sometimes just working on your projects, and projects are expected to be completed over weekends as well. In addition, the last couple weeks which are dedicated to projects are not as structured as the first 9 or so weeks.

247062,2019.0,True,"It's madness, but eventually there's a method","Let me first start with this... this boot camp IS NOT for everyone. What I mean by that is that IT IS intense. You will be stressed out by the amount of work you have to do, the lack of time (or at least the feeling of it) and ultimately the strictness that is enforced.

There is a device & attendance strike system (that could lead to dismissal) to make sure people aren't being distracted by their phones, laptops, whatever instead of doing their work. This can be a pro or a con depending on your perspective. They WILL dismiss you if you fail 2 of the 6 assessments that happen within the first 5-1/2 weeks. Curriculum topics change every 1 to 1.5 weeks. If you're completely new to programming, there isn't much time to deeply absorb the topics before moving on to another one.

From a materials standpoint, some of the videos, articles, and information that they use is between 3-5 years old. That's ancient in the world of tech. At times, the instructions used in pair programming or for the projects (or the homework) can be vague & unintentionally (or intentionally?) misleading. Often times I was frustrated by how little focus the work presented seemed to have.

There were a few times where it felt less like inspiration/motivation and more like scare-tactics were used to get people to do their work. The assessments carry so much weight that a few of my classmates failed because they freaked out during the test and couldn't recover. The instructors tell you to ""make sure you sleep"", ""take care of yourself"", etc. But then there's a timed assessment that basically dictates your future looming over your head. And every day is regimented, scheduled, lectured and pre-determined for you, that there isn't time to catch up from anything in the previous days.

This all may sound scary, and intimidating or more like a military boot camp, than a coding one (I sometimes wonder if that's really what they're going for), but after the assessments are done, and the weight of dismissal has been lifted, things start to make sense. Around Week 7/8 is when you start to build your fullstack project. For me at least, this is where all the pieces began to come together. Each of the topics that we learned finally had a place, and while you still don't know everything about any of it all, you have at least a base understanding that you can build from. You can start to ask questions about where to begin, where to go, what you want to do, etc.

To be clear, the level of knowledge that you gain once the first 9 weeks are done WILL allow you to build a fullstack, fully working app. Will it be the next Facebook, Google, Instagram or Snapchat? Highly unlikely, but you now have a solid foundation that could possibly get you there.

All in all, my outlook on the program is that I didn't much care for certain portions of it while going through it, but I am thankful for being shown the frustrations, intricacies and the BS that comes with web development. As they say, ""what doesn't dismiss you from bootcamp, only makes you a stronger software dev"" (or something like that ;-) ).

So to conclude, this school isn't for everyone, it doesn't need to be. If you thrive in pressure or at least know yourself well enough to be able to work through intense situations, then this may be for you. Just know that it's not going to be pretty. It's not going to be easy. But if you make it through, you should feel rewarded.

246626,2018.0,True,Best decision I've made,"After working in the restaurant business for five years, I was skeptical about trying to make the switch into the tech industry.  However, let me tell you how my App Academy experience went! After being accepted, I was given a plethora of great material to get up to speed. REALLY STUDY THIS MATERIAL. Taking the time to go through all of it and thoroughly comprehending all of the concepts immensely helps once the cohort begins. The last few weeks leading up to the course start date they have ""open house"" study sessions with 1-2 App Academy instructors/TAs to help answer any questions. I suggest taking note of the things that give you trouble and having questions prepared in advance to ask the staff in person. There's also a Slack channel where everyone can help each other out. After my first official day, I was surprised by how enthusiastic the everyone was! The culture at A/a really is amazing. All of the instructors and TAs are very patient and super nice. The days are very long but since you pair up with someone new everyday time flies. Stay on top of the homework, get enough sleep, ask a lot of questions and you'll have an exceptional experience.

The material is challenging and fast paced but you'll receive all the guidance you need as support from App Academy. Be prepared to dedicate a portion of your hours outside of the class to studying, otherwise you are not taking full advantage of the course.

246885,2018.0,True,Recommended,"There is no exaggeration about how difficult the program is. This isn't specifically in regards to the material, but the entire program itself. Considering that <5% of applicants get accepted and still there are students that get kicked out, it isn't about how difficult the material is. Students get kicked out because they are not prepared for a bootcamp. The full-time program is rigorous, strict, and fast-paced. There is no time to catch up if you fall behind because everyday there is brand new material to become familiar with before the next day. Preparing for a bootcamp comes down to how much time and energy you are willing to completely dedicate to the program. Those that slept enough, ate well, studied hard, minimized distractions, worked on the prep material thoroughly, and remained consistently focused had a better chance at succeeding.

The program is designed to teach students many skills in as short a time as possible. It is structured to expose students to new material through various methods and then solidify that knowledge with practical exercises. On top of that, the instructors are more than happy to help every student with any issue. It is clear how passionate they are about programming as well as teaching. The environment is welcoming and encouraging. I have never been taught by a more dedicated group of instructors and I have never learned alongside such hardworking and persistent classmates.

Not going to lie, this is a challenging experience that has many struggles. If you are not willing or ready to put in the effort required you will not succeed. With that being said, if you commit yourself to the work and buy in this will be one of the most rewarding things you participate in. You will learn a set of wonderful new skills and you will develop the confidence to dive into the unknown, knowing you can come out the other side. Be prepared to have many sleep deprived days. Be prepared to feel behind and lost. And just be prepared to work as hard as you can.

246500,2017.0,True,Toughest thing you'll ever do. But worth it.,"The review will be split in two parts

Part 1: Curriculum
- Rapid fire pace. The sheer amount of material you're expected to cover on a daily basis is overwhelming.
My suggestion for the daily homeworks. At least take a quick look at the material before you pass out for the night, simply having exposure to the material will help you reinforce it in the morning lecture .


Part 2: Job Search
If you were thought completing the main curriculum would led to a job right away. I have some bad news..
Job search is a whole different challenge in itself. Simply knowing the technical material and having projects on your resume isn't enough.
- You have to be able to play the social game (build rapport with recruiters/managers/engs), and be able to explain complex concepts in a simple way.
- You have to be able to code, think, and sometimes speak at the same time during phone screens

Of course, some people got jobs quickly, and others would job search for 9+ months before landing a position.

The teaching staff has an impressively thorough grasp of the entire curriculum, and the job placements team is really concerned with getting to know your individual strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Occasionally alumni were invited to give guest lectures on the main curriculum, and I would love to see App Academy provide more opportunities like these for current students to see where the material they are learning exists in the real world. 

I would also mention that my cohort was one of the brightest and most colorful and driven groups of peers I have had the pleasure to work with.

I'm someone who likes structure and I think App Academy did a really good job structuring their curriculum. People weren't lying when they say they've spent 80+ hours a week. I've spent at least 80-100+ hours a week. This style doesn't fit for everyone, and I think that's important to note. There are assessments that act more as checkpoints to ensure students are able to keep up with the material, so it's important manage your time properly and study for them. Pair programming is also a big focus which overall I found pretty helpful. I found that the TA's were all very helpful and knowledgable as well.

The reviews I've read before coming on were intimidating regarding the workload, and they are mostly true! It IS a lot of work - but honestly, it breezed by because it was so much fun! And then it feels just that much more rewarding.  I'd say one of my favorite things about App Academy were the people. The TAs and your peers are your best resources.  TAs were superb. They are there to help you, and they really mean it. They are so genuinely nice, brilliant, and rooting for your success. And all have went through the course as well and know exactly what it's like in your shoes. My peers were awesome. I've made great great great friends and know that I'll be in close contact with them for years to come! It was awesome being challenged together and working towards a goal. Finding a good support system and surrounding yourself with other superstars made the whole course crazy fun & flash by. You get to know a lot of people through the pair programming you do every day, and it's been one of the greatest tools for me to practice ARTICULATING my thought process and code. It's pretty mentally exhausting to have to talk and code, talk and code, etc.. but you do see yourself grow in terms of slowing down and breaking out problems since you have to verbally explain it to another ear.

246302,2018.0,True,Very challenging but super rewarding,"App Academy has a very different structure compared to other bootcamps in the nation. One of the main differences is that their success comes after your success. The instructors and TAs truly devote their best energy and effort in teaching you everything to become a real software engineer by the end of the program. Throughout those 12 weeks, you will be learning new materials almost everyday and able to apply those new skills to your daily pair programming and projects. You will also be challenged on 6 assessments in order to retain your spot in the program; however, those assessments are the positive reinforcement to push you to learn. One of my favorite moments at a/A is when I completed my full-stack project with all the skills I learned from the program. That kind of satisfaction cannot be expressed in words. If you are also thinking of becoming a software engineer, I would highly recommend you to apply to a/A because there is no better place than this bootcamp.",1/4/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
246897,2018.0,True,Best out of 3,"I have attended 2 other full stack web development schools and App Academy is by far the best.  Their curriculum is very well structured for the beginner and the advanced students.  It really doesn't matter what level you come from, App Academy is challenging but you definitely come out better for it in the end.

Other courses I learned how to build applications.  That is OK if I wanted to freelance or work for some small start up company.  But I have bigger dreams.  I want to work for a big 4 (or 5) company and one day start my own company involving tech.  In order to do that I needed to have a deeper understanding than putting code together.  Ask anyone that works for a big tech company or what makes the difference between a good programmer and a great one.  They will all tell you they understand how things work more.

One of the criticisms I hear is that App Academy has a good portion of their curriculum using Ruby.  I understand it is not as popular of a language as JavaScript and Python but the part I like is how they use the language to teach concepts of computer science that are extremely useful going into a big company or building your own.  Think of it this way, they trade you getting deep knowledge of software engineering for the trade off of learning a popular language.  Having worked with 3 other languages and familiar with about 10, Ruby is a really really easy language to learn and why struggle with a language when you can struggle and grow with concepts and understanding of software engineering as a whole.

Take my advice, if you're looking for a web development bootcamp, take App Academy.  It is the best.",1/4/2019,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
246259,2018.0,True,My App Academy Experience,"Deciding to go to App Academy has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I was previously working in a chemistry lab and resented going to work everyday. I was always interested in coding and decided to make the jump. App Academy's deferred payment plan also gave me peace of mind and not stress financially. 

The course itself was challenging. There are going to be some long nights and you will struggle.  But there is a reason why so many App Academy students get hired. It works. People say that everybody at App Academy really wants to see you succeed and I definitely agree. 

There are things that I think App Academy could improve on. Some people argue that Ruby on Rails should be phased out in favor for a different framework. I think that this is a viable argument, but at the same time I learned a lot about the MVC architecture.

There are assessments virtually every week and they are crucial for you to pass in order to stay within the program. Because there is such a heavy emphasis on these assessments, the learning environment goes from learning as much as you can to try to pass these tests. Be prepared to spend hours studying and working on homework. Don't be afraid to ask questions. You pair program every single day. If you understand everything and your partner doesn't, slow down and explain it to them. Your partner will appreciate it a lot. If it takes you a while to understand, don't be afraid to slow your partner down and ask questions. It is your learning too. There is an overwhelming amount of staff support every step of the way, so don't be afraid to get to know them too. Your end goal is to absorb as much knowledge as you can and if you don't quite understand everything, that is okay too. Your full stack project is where you can solidify your understanding of everything. Overall, this is an amazing learning experience.

246207,2018.0,True,Full Stack Intensive,"App Academy has been extremely challenging but all the while rewarding. It is definitely what you make of it. If you put in the time and the effort, you will come out proud as can be thinking  - ""Oh wow, I really learned all of this in just a few months"" and ""Did I really just create a website from scratch in a couple weeks?"" I really enjoyed my time at App Academy and am so glad I took the course. Here are my pros and cons of the Full Stack Intensive:

Pros:
- Great group of TA's who put in extra time to help students, even on weekends. These TA's go above and beyond to help the students. They were once students themselves and know what each student is going through. They really want each student to succeed and will make sure to get them the help they need.
- Friendly and safe environment as well as inclusive
- Admissions process really brings in people who are very well-rounded and have absolute determination to succeed (and to get in job in the end) - I was surrounded by people who I thought was much smarter than me and hardworking which caused me to push myself to improve everyday
- Curriculum includes a ton of hands on learning - projects everyday to make you apply new concepts directly to code
- Ton of pair programming - a lot of opportunities to collaborate with other programmers and learn other techniques/methods

Cons:
- Some material/projects(not too many) of the curriculum were not very clear - the instructions were difficult to understand which obstructed my ability to get far in those projects during those days
- Ton of pair programming - as mentioned above, it's a great aspect, but sometimes it becomes too much - dense material can be difficult to understand in a few days and I personally found it beneficial when we had some solo programming days to really struggle through the day's projects on our own

App Academy's curriculum is structured to train you to be a full-stack developer, which means it includes how to code in the back end and in the front end. The coding curriculum basically builds you up to be able to make your very own full-stack project that you will want to have in your resume. If you are looking to work in the tech industry but do not have time to finish a 4-year CS or IT degree, App Academy is definitely a route worth looking into.",11/26/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
238651,2018.0,True,"Hard, fun, coding experience that leans towards front-end development.","I had a great experience at App Academy, however I'm just starting the job curriculum so I cannot speak to the job guarantee or the quality of the last portion of the curriculum. The course material is structured in a way that helps the students focus on learning instead of trying to discover what is worth learning. This is the main advantage of the bootcamp opposed to trying to learn the material on your own. The curriculum is good in this sense, but don't expect to learn everything or even cover everything that a junior developer should know. The curriculum is intensive, but introductory. Think of the curriculum as a spring-board for learning more on your own outside of working hours and after the conclusion of the program. 

The TAs / instructors are also what make the program worth it. They are invested in helping you and making sure that you understand the material. That being said, you must study, or you will fall behind and get kicked out. This means putting in a lot of hours and letting the curriculum consume you. Even then, you must study hard & study smart. Long hours of work doesn't guarantee mastery, so learn how to study before you show up.

The people you work with will be awesome. Your peers are usually quite driven and all on the same career path as you. This being said, you will have to learn how to work with different people with different personalities. Be the kind of person you would want to work with. Since the foundation of the first 7 weeks is pair-programming, this program is not for people that cannot interact well with others. 

The classroom environment is not the greatest. You sit on a crowded floor at long tables (full of mac minis) coding all day with a partner. The chairs are terrible and you will start to feel it if you don't get up often. The lecture hall consists of 50+ folding chairs that also feel terrible (especially after 3 hours of lecture). Don't fall for the nice looking banner pictures on the website that portray these hipsters drinking coffee in lounging couches while coding. That's not what this program is, that is just clever marketing. I highly suggest, that anyone interested in attending A/A come visit the work sites. It is not a deal breaker, but you should have an accurate view of the place you will be spending the next 3 months. 

Lastly, if your finances permit, don't take the deferred payment option. Be motivated, do well, and pay upfront. The huge caveat is that you need to do well and not get kicked out. If you have more questions about this, then just do the math between the two plans, and ask questions. Don't just blindly sign an agreement until you understand everything.

Overall, I have been enjoying the program, however, I don't think that this program is for everyone. Make sure you do your hw before committing.",11/26/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,,app-academy

245812,2018.0,True,A good choice if you know what you're getting into,"Let me start by saying that my experience at App Academy was overall positive. I think the curriculum and the pace at which it's taught is fantastic. If I could go back and make the decision whether to go or not knowing what I know now, I would still choose to go. You need to be willing to spend the time though; you should not have a terribly active social life or spend much time goofing off outside of class. The main goal of the bootcamp is to teach you what you need to know to get a job in the shortest time possible, and you need to be serious about that if you are signing up.

That being said, there are a few areas where I was highly disappointed. First, they say that they care about your ergonomic health, but this is not true in the slightest. They have no options for better keyboards or mice, no monitors at eye level, horrible chairs. This may get better in the future based on some of the conversations I had, but I wouldn't count on it. Cohorts are in and out of there in 9 weeks so there is little incentive to actually make the working conditions better. The other area of disappointment was the availability of the instructors. There is this ""question button"" you can hit to have an instructor come over to you, but I waited upwards of 45 minutes in some situations.On the other side of that though, you do need to be self-sufficient and be able to find the answer on your own sometimes. You'll need to do that in real life anyways.

So, besides some major drawbacks, I think App Academy is worth it if you know what you're getting into.",11/26/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.5,[],4.0,5.0,,app-academy
245793,2018.0,True,I have come so far since I started,"I think about how different it would have been if I didn't choose to study with a bootcamp and tried learning on my own.  I wouldn't have been able to complete as much as I did in such a short time.  The information is difficult to grasp quickly, but setting your only focus for the bootcamp is important to learning the material quickly.  I also wouldn't have learned as much if I had tried to learn the material on my own.  On my own I would try to learn what I need to learn to make my website operational, which would have left  a lot more holes in the knowledge of programing that I have now. Lastly, the price seems very steep, but I find it to be worth it in terms of the value comparison of a college education.  I graduated with a structural civil engineering degree but I find this fullstack course to be more challenging, more valuable, more productive time spent for a higher education and the overall cost was cheaper than unreduced cost of my degree",11/25/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
242251,2018.0,True,It will change your life.,"I actually got a job after completing App Academy's in-person full-time curriculum in NYC.  I wanted to wait until I actually got an offer, so here it is.

If you're looking at this review, you're probably looking to make a career-change or gain an edge in landing that first software development role after graduating University (or High School?).  For me, it was absolutely worth it.

1. This is one of the only coding bootcamps which hold you to a certain learning-pace with weekly assessments for the first 8-ish weeks.  If you fall behind and fail two of them, you're out of the program, and trust me this will take a lot of work to pass.  It ensures that you actually learned the material and can do the basics, but the pace of this program isn't for everyone.  You will wake up in the morning, get to the office, code all day, go home, work on HW assignments, code some more, sleep, then repeat for 3 months.  You will literally live/eat/breathe code for the duration and you'll learn so much, but this brings up my second point.

2. You will have no life during the program.  When people say this in the reviews, they're not being excessive.  I almost had a panic attack on the night before my first assessment (Sunday) because I was struggling with some concepts.  You will learn a new concept and then be expected to pass an assessment on it the following week, while already learning new material.  Tell your friends/girlfriend/family/dog that you'll pay attention to them after 3 months.  (For reference, my cohort had like 20% of the cohort drop out...  This isn't a joke)

3. You will meet some of the most brilliant people you've ever met in your cohort.  We've had Ivy-League grads, WallStreet guys, Entrepreneurs, Musicians, Basement gamers who want to finally get a job, etc...  They were from all different backgrounds, but almost every single one of them were brilliant in their own way.  I actually felt dumb for the first time in my life.  Being surrounded by these people and pair-programming with each of them every single day will help you learn and see code in a different way.  You'll also learn how to deal with not-so-favorable people, which will help you during your actual job (stubborn/argumentative people, keyboard hogs, etc), but these interactions are rare.

4. The Job-Search support is actually one of the best parts of this curriculum.  Technical and Non-Technical interviewing is a skill just like programming, and you'll gain a ton of practice white boarding and talking about yourself/background.  My career coach was the best hype-man I could've ever asked for, and I think he actually helped me ultimately land my first role.

If you put in the work, and you pass all the assessments, you'll land a job.  A vast majority of my cohort all landed jobs within the first 6-months after program completion.
The most important part is putting in the work after you actually finish the program (Job-Search is honestly the hardest part because there's minimal hand holding and you're actually competing for roles against other people who often have CS degrees).  There's no time for an extended break after completing the program.  Start working on more features on your fullstack project, start learning data structures / algorithms more in depth, white board at least once a week, etc...  It will take a lot of work.  The best part is that you have access to the office at all times, so you can go in to work while you look for a job even after you complete the program.

For me, this program changed my life and I'm thankful I went through it.

Lastly, I want to share one tip:  Before you start the program, you absolutely should complete a beginner's web-development ""course"" on freecodecamp or Udemy.  It goes a LONG way, trust me.",11/20/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
245132,2018.0,True,"Fun, Exciting, and Challenging","Before this program, I took App Academy's bootcamp prep. I had no previous knowledge of computer science and wanted to learn how to make applications. App Academy for me personally did require almost 100 hours each week. I would not recommend to someone, who isn't willing to put in the work. However, if you do, you will be able to create amazing apps and be proud of your creations.

Pros: Love how much App Academy pushes you, the TAs / staff are fantastic and accommodating. When you reach the job search curriculum, they help you with the nontechnical portion.
Cons: Before you start, there is an alpha curriculum. Without previous experience, the alpha curriculum was difficult to do.

241032,2018.0,True,A Bootcamp in the Truest Sense,"Originally I thought App Academy was going to be a medium intensity coding bootcamp where at the end of the day I'd still have enough time to have personal time. I was wrong, oh so very wrong. Even after the day ended at 6pm, in order to keep up and retain the day's materials, I had to study until 11pm every day. Weekends are no exceptions because of the incredibly face-paced nature of this program. However, despite not having a life and the stresses attached to this program, I regret nothing. I have learned so much in such a short period of time it's actually amazing. I went from knowing nothing about code to building a websites and programs. If I had the option of joining this program again, I'd do it again.",11/8/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
245623,2018.0,True,What you should think about before applying to App Academy,"App Academy is an intense program.  The learning environment is rigorous.  The culture changes from cohort to cohort, but in my experience, people have been eager to collaborate, learn, and help each other succeed.  Felt like I was back in college (a faster paced and more intense version)

Everyday, you spend time pair programming, which means that you are coding with a partner.  One person explains the code, the other person types, and you switch off every 15 minutes.  As a verbal processor, I found this very helpful in my understanding of different concepts.

I would estimate that in addition to the 9-6 5 days/ week that you are at App Academy, you have about 2 hours/ night of homework.  That nets out to about 60 hours/ week for the first 2/3rd and this ramps up significantly when the portfolio projects start.

The projects are pretty brutal and require a lot of work.

I would recommend this program if you are serious about becoming a software developer.  A good litmus test is to try out App Academy's Bootcamp Prep course or some free/ inexpensive resources on CodeAcademy, Udemy, etc.  App Academy's entire curriculum is also available for free online.

Timeline: It took me about 2 months to go from 0 coding knowledge to being ready to take App Academy's technical interview.  After that, there was a mandatory prep course that was fully online for 1 month.  The actual program is 13 weeks.  I'm currently job searching, and the average time it takes someone to find a job after graduation is between 3-6 months.

The three questions I would ask myself before doing App Academy are:

Am I serious about wanting to learn coding/ would I actually enjoy working in this field?
Do I have what it takes to learn and master the material?
Am I financially able and willing to devote the above mentioned timeline to learning to code and developing projects without pay full time?

This program is by far one of the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, coming from completely non-coding background to being able to put together a functional application in a span of  12 weeks is pretty amazing.

245618,2018.0,True,You Will Learn a Lot,"App Academy is the hardest I have ever worked. There is a lot of self teaching, but one of the greatest aspects are your cohort-mates.

The environment is friendly, non-judgmental, and having the resource of the other students is extremely valuable to learning.  I will not sugar-coat it: you will constantly be working.  You will be working on the weekends.  You will be coding more than anything else. That's not an exaggeration. Average hours of sleep of night depends on the person. Some people do get 7 hours of sleep, I'd say average is 5-6 hours. But you will learn a lot in a very short amount of time.

231628,2018.0,True,Tough but enlightening,"I went through the May 21st 2018 cohort of a/A. It was one of the most intimidating, challenging, and rewarding experiences of my life. I will separate the pros and cons out and then give additional thoughts.

Pros:

- I made some amazing friends that I will try to stay in contact with, we bonded deeply through the trials that we went through. This was one of the best benefits of the program
- I am now employed as a software engineer and I am making double what I was earning before, living where I want to live, working for a cause I care about
- I feel like I have a skill that makes me marketable and valuable, that gives me a greater sense of independence from the employer I will work for
- I gained confidence in my ability to learn a complex skill fast
- I can type 75 wpm, despite starting the cohort at 35ish 
- My interview skills were far better than I expected after the program, I think the pressure of the assessments makes technical interview pressure pale in comparison
- I built a full-stack web app, mostly on my own that looked awesome on my portfolio
- I was able to get a job after only two months of applying after the cohort ended
- Lot's of people in my cohort got jobs at a/A after which helped them
- Strong emphasis on CSS which is boring at first but ends up being very important

Cons: 

- Serious lack of CS teaching
- I was horrified and unsure of whether or not I would make it through the program until I passed assessment 5
- I had to live in a place I hate to attend the program
- The assessments are scary and sometimes are significantly harder than the practice assessments, so you don't know what to expect
- Most TA's solidly taught and understood the material for our cohort, but often times the TA's are teaching you the just after completing a cohort, so they don't have mastery over it. I wish they had more experienced TA's with CS backgrounds who deeply understood the material
- Some people were far worse than others in the cohort an they sucked up lots of the instruction time, I felt TA's could have done a better job of prioritizing assistance
- They teach Ruby (which is a dying language) and JS, when they really should be teaching Python and JS
- Career coaches can come off as job application enforcers, and mine didn't help me get my foot in any door, he just tried to give me advice which was occasionally helpful
- 5/10k is a lot of money to lose if you fail the cohort, that's takes a real mental toll to try to study when you have that much money on the line
- Working 90-100 hours a week for 2.5 months was emotionally draining and I usually could only take 2 hours or so off per week

Additional Thoughts:

After searching for jobs for 2 months, I realized that Python would have been far better to learn than Ruby. Everyone uses it basically. Other bootcamps probably teach Python and JS and that might make the job search easier. I like Ruby, but I find it hard to recommend the program because of the decision to teach Ruby and not Python. 

The cost is fairly high, and so it is hard to enroll in a/A without some money in the bank. It ends up being a sort of accelerator for already privileged people, which is not what they necessarily advertise. This is just how it is unfortunately. Also the advertisements are inaccurate because most people don't get jobs at Google unless they were TA's at a/A for some time. 

Another thing is that a/A is somewhat of a revolving door, I am noticing that the best instructors leave almost as soon as they become fully capable instructors. This might lead to lower quality instruction. a/A doesn't have good organization as a company and people working for them complain about things like not getting paid and constant misunderstandings. 

I would never go through something like this again, but I can't deny that it worked for me and most of my cohort. About 50% of us landed jobs, and fast. However, a few of the other 50% of students were able to get through but some of them mysteriously seem like they still don't understand coding, and were able to get through by just memorizing practice assessments. I think this set of people is might struggle for a long time and maybe give up. The weeding out is not as intense as it should be. 

a/A was scary and intense but it imposes immense focus on you that allows you to surpass your previous ignorance and gain serious skills that make you employable, and eventually well paid. I turned my whole life around in just 9 months (I studied a lot before the program). I have a love hate relationship with it but more love than hate overall.

The strong reputation that App Academy has in the industry is well-deserved - the quality of education is excellent, and the instructors do a great job of presenting the material in a clear and concise manner. The curriculum designers are also constantly aware of current technology trends, and are unafraid of completely revamping their instructional materials to ensure that what they teach is relevant in industry.

However, while the program claims that no prior programming experience is necessary to get in, I found that the vast majority of people who completed the program and excelled in my cohort had some kind of technical background, ranging from CS/STEM majors, to some basic web design experience. This is not to say that those who came in with no experience did not finish the program, but rather that they had to be a lot more self-sufficient and proactive about learning the material in order to keep up.

Everyone here is brilliant, and everyone works their absolute butt off.  I have a background in elite international sports, and this is by far the hardest I've ever worked for an extended period of time.

You will learn a HUGE amount of web development in a hilariously short amount of time, and by the end of it, you'll be building a clone of a full scale web app in 10 days.  I did spotify, and it is a project I am tremendously proud of, and had a great time doing it.

That said, it is hard.  App Academy will challenge every part of you.  It straings you mentally, emotionally, and physically, and puts a tremendous strain on any relationships you have during the program.  Talk with your significant other about it before attending, because you will barely see them during the 12 week program, and when you do, your mind will be on code.

For me, if you told me I'd be able to pass all this 3 months ago, I would have felt this was way over my head. In the last 10 weeks, I've learned about myself. I've learned to learn.  There has been a great amount of help from TAs and classmates. I've learned to take all their styles and watch how they work and just pick a part of it. One clear example was while working on my CSS for my project, I was going back and forth between my text editor and browser to see changes I've made. After having a TA to come help solve a bug, I got to see how they handled CSS and found a more efficient way to work by making changes in the browser that has a immediate change. That is just one of many example of how I've learn to work  through the techniques of others.

245372,2018.0,True,Intense Program but worth it in the end,"App Academy has been an intense ride. There were many highs and lows throughput the process but I do feel like I've learned so much in such a short span.  a/A teaches you how to learn quick. Although recently they have published the course online, the support system here is the real value. The instructors/TAs here are super supportive and patient. The pair programming experience was both amazing and dreadful pending on the people. Everyone who was enrolled definitely have the potential but quite a few folks have been dismissed from the assessments...but doesn't mean they won't become a developer one day. This program definitely isn't for everyone because it's both fast pace and stressful. My real grip with the program is that I wish they did deep dive a bit more on topics but at the same time, you can only fit so much in a 12/13 week program. 

 My biggest advice for anyone who's aspiring to take this journey:
- make sure you understand the concepts well. Don't just be ""oh I get it"". You should be able to explain it to anyone. The material does build on top each week and some topics will be reintroduced a week or two later.
-get some sleep. to be honest, the homework does HELP you but don't lose sleep over it. they do go over the topic/concepts the next morning but I would advise not completely ditching it",10/21/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
245371,2018.0,True,App Academy was a really supportive environment and a great learning experience,"App Academy's learning model really worked for me. It is by no means easy- it's incredibly long hours, and lot's of asking questions, but if you do those two things, you have the tools you need to succeed. The days generally are like this: you start with either a 30 minute CSS exercise, or you immediately go in the lecture hall for a lecture that is usually from 1.5 to 3 hours. Then,  either before or after lunch, start your pair programming projects, where you are matched with a new person every day to work on a project that covers from the basics to very complex problems about the topic you just learned in lecture.  Every day there are 3 things expected of you that will prepare you for the project that day- 1) you watch the lecture videos/do the readings on the topic they will be teaching the next day, 2) you do the homework to the best of your ability, to familiarize yourself with the topic, and 3) if you have any time left, you review the previous day's project to expose yourself to any topics you may not have gotten to in class. You are exposed to the topics you learn 3-4 times, like the readings, homework, lecture, and daily projects, and so although the pace is fast, you pick up on them soon just by repeated exposure. There are also so many opportunities to ask questions, and the TAs are so helpful and dedicated and will spend huge amounts of time making sure you really solidly understand a topic. My advice is to ask as many questions as you can until you can fully explain the topic to somebody else, and to accept that for 3 months this will be your life. In the end, you really are equipped with the skills to be a great web developer.",10/21/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy

I will tell you that I saw smart people drop out just because of the sheer volume of things we learn in 8 weeks. Most drop out around week 4 when we hit Ruby on Rails. The passing rate for assessments is set at 85% of specifications, (App Academy grades using Rspec).

Solid pro-tip if you're interested in getting ahead ,  learn Rails before App Academy. It's the center stone of the curriculum and what you're going to be using to build out your full stack application during week 8. Rails is  an awful lot to digest in 10 days during the course. I really commend my cohort members who managed to swallow Rails, pass A4 with flying colors, and build an amazing full stack application.

Some thoughts for prospective students:
1. You'll hear time and again, that the Full-Stack course is not easy. If you're not comfortable coming in early and/or staying late, working weekends and really grinding, you will not have a good time.

2. The instructors are excellent, caring, invested, patient and knowledgeable. Be proactive with using them as a resource.

3. If you're transitioning into this course from a full-time job, I would strongly recommend leaving your job with at least 2 weeks to prepare before the course starts.

And after going through the curriculum, I now understand what they were saying about the difficulty of this course and why they were saying it. BUT I also understand why App Academy still gets all these amazing reviews. 

Difficulty: 
This course is HARD. On day 1, the head instructor made a joke that we should tell our friends and family that we're going on a 12 week cruise. He was joking, but at the same time... he wasn't. My personal experience of the workload at App Academy was get to class around 7//7:30am to finish up whatever homework I didn't complete the night before, 9am-6pm class time. 6pm -8:30//9pm homework and then rinse and repeat for Mon-Fri. Generally I would take Friday night off to give myself a mental break, but Saturday and Sunday you could find myself and most of the App Academy Students in the classroom Studying for the Assessments. 
TLDR: This class is no joke. You cannot have a social life and succeed in this bootcamp. (At the very least don't expect to unless, you may be able to get a night out here and there if somehow you're ahead on the material)

Assessments:
Yes this is one of the few BootCamps that relies on Assessments. Yes they are very stressful. Yes there is a lot of practice work given to help you pass these assessments. Yes they are hard. HOWEVER, I couldn't be happier that we had these assessments. At the end of the day, you can sit through the lectures, you can do the homeworks and finish the in class assignments, but practicing and studying for these assessments is what really drills the information into your brain. Keep in mind though, you can be removed from the program if you fail two assessments. This can make the program a lot more stressful for people who are either not good test takers or do not put the work in. These assessments are not made to trick you, but made to make sure you know the minimum amount of knowledge to continue with the program. Without that minimum knowledge, you will not succeed with the rest of the program.
TLDR: Assessments are hard, but not if you keep up with the work and study on weekends. Bad test takers, beware

Instructors:
The instructors are absolutely awesome. All instructors are extremely knowledgeable in the topics being taught, and clearly have extensive experience in teaching the material. They're all also extremely helpful

Culture:
The Culture at a/A is extremely welcoming, and I can tell that I will remain friends with many of my cohort-mates for many years to come. We've spent many many hours in class together and even more on slack.

Worth it?
100%. We are just starting the job application process now, but from everyone I've talked to who is in a place to hire Software Developers, App Academy consistently trains the strongest job candidates from all the other BootCamps in NYC. No matter your background or previous experience in coding, you can succeed in this class with the right amount of work. I personally did not have any coding experience and am currently feeling super confident going into the job search process.

Spending around 80 - 100 hours a week to learn, understand, and apply the material will be needed to be able to do well. You will jump from one thing to the next and you need to be able to keep up as it'll be harder when you fall behind. If you are ready to do just that, you are well on your way to attend an awesome program. 

I've previously learned coding at my university; however, this was different in the fact that everything was fast-paced and they were more practical rather than how it was in school. Well of course, this is a 12 week program, everything jumps out at you just like that. Please do not get discouraged by the fact that I said that I had a bit of coding experience, it really doesn't make a big of a difference. The majority of the people in this program haven't coded before and they've come to enjoy coding and built a passion for it. The material was intense, however, if you keep pushing, you can do it. 

The thing I like about this program is the community. You attend the same program with 30-40 other people, work with them, and build a connection. The networking community builds from that and who knows where that'll take you. You will be glad to have met your cohort-mates as this experience was well worth it.

Putting in a lot of work to learn the material and build projects take up a lot of your time, but when it comes down to it, you made something. You learned something. You were able to do something. If you are not committed to learning code or think that this program is a waste of time, then this program isn't for you.

Also I want to add that people with no prior experience coding can excel in this program, so long as you put in the work. Most of my cohort-mates did not know how to code before entering this program and still did well.

The program is fast-paced, so you will not have time to go back on things you may have missed and everything builds upon another so you will have to keep-up, otherwise you'll fall behind.

After week 9 I am now capable of creating a full-stack application, which is crazy considering how much I knew (or should I say how much I didn't know) 9 weeks ago.

You will need to put in work. In order to make the most out of this program, you will need to put in 80 - 100 hours a week studying, doing the readings, completing homework & projects. But trust me, it will all be worth it in the end.

At the end of the day, I can't say that this program is for everyone. You will have to want to learn to code badly enough to be successful coming out of a/A.

The coding curriculum is two month, so you have to learn very fast and be willing to work very hard. The materials provided by the curriculum is valuable and can be best used going through them thoroughly.

244867,2018.0,True,13 weeks later,"Overall: if you're looking for a relatively fast track to switching career paths or accelerating your preexisting programming experience, App Academy is a great option to consider. The main caveat is the extreme time commitment required by the course. 80 hours per week of work is realistic; more if you want to excel. If you have other non-negotiable commitments such as family or volunteering responsibilities, accept that you may fall behind and have to work harder. 

The App Academy curriculum is excellent. Teaching competency of instructors varies – some are excellent, some are mediocre – but honestly it's probably as good as you can expect from any coding bootcamp. Instructor support overall is very good. Everything you need for a solid foundation to begin the cohort is provided throughout the application process; what's key is setting aside enough time to properly absorb the material (at least two months prior to interviewing, a month between the first and last interview, and a month between admission and cohort start time). The provided prep material is time intensive in its own right, and most who struggle to keep up didn't spend enough time preparing. Time to catch up after beginning the cohort is almost non-existent. 

What makes aA stand out: 
- Rigid structure of accountability through roll calls, assignments, and assessments. Like having a good physical trainer, you may often hate the diet and the workouts in the moment, but in the long run you'll be surprised how much you progress. 
 - Constant pair programming and collaborative work. Especially taxing for introverts, but enormously helpful in learning how to communicate effectively. A significant advantage over solo/remote study options, and even most university curricula. 
- Outstanding job search curriculum. Lots of very helpful workshops, application prep, and interview practice. 

Can you learn everything taught in a bootcamp on your own? Almost certainly. What you're paying for is the opportunity to learn it faster, make connections with other students/instructors, and receive solid career coaching.

246317,2018.0,True,Completely Honest Review (NY),"I plan to be honest and critical, but full disclosure: I am receiving a hoodie for writing this review.  I graduated a/A last month, and next week I'll be starting as a front-end developer.

Here's what you need to know:

The a/A curriculum is fantastic.  It covers a lot of ground quickly, so make sure this is something you're good at/enjoy before committing.  I spent 12-14 hours a day coding while in the first 9 weeks of the program.  If you're not into that, don't sign up.

The structure is 9 weeks of learning, followed by 3 weeks of working on projects and preparing for the job search.

The ""job search"" is a 1 year commitment.  They require you to apply to 40 jobs a week, and keep doing so for at least 6 months during this time.  You can only accept offers over 60k, and it must be full-time.

What I liked best:

The curriculum is comprehensive, and really pushes you to learn this stuff inside-out.

My classmates were amazing, hardworking people.  Made a lot of friends while in the program.

What wasn't so good:

The job search is 100% on you.  They have no employer network, and do absolutely nothing to connect you with employers.  You will have to find companies to apply to, apply to them, go through 3-6 rounds of interviews, and negotiate your own offer. 

95% of companies will immediately dismiss you because you have no experience and no CS degree.  a/A's reputation does not permeate in NY, employers usually have no clue what a/A is, and aren't interested in hiring bootcamp grads

That being said, the 5% that let you in the door will be impressed by your skills.  So keep your head up and keep applying and working on projects.  The offer/offers will come.

My overall experience was good.  But this is tough stuff, don't be a fool and sign up without thinking it through.  You must have resilience, and some degree of natural talent with code to get through this process.  If you have those things, it will be the most rewarding and empowering experience of your life.",9/14/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.3,[],4.0,5.0,1.0,app-academy

- people
- learn a lot of stuff( Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, Javascript)
- great TA's

Cons:
- no time for anything else
- super fast-paced

Attending App Academy has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've had. There were many times where I felt completely lost, but the TA staff at App Academy was always super accommodating and willing to patiently teach any of us that needed the help. If you are willing to drop everything and commit 9 weeks to see if coding is for you, there isn't a program out there I'd recommend more so than App Academy.",9/14/2018,,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
236634,2018.0,True,AA Review,"App Academy as a 3 month boot camp intensive is without a doubt one of the most difficult curriculums I've gone through. You will continuously learn new material and review previous material so be prepared to plan your time for this camp. The staff here is incredibly helpful with questions, kind, do try their best to accomodate. The material provided constantly updates to try and be up to date with the latest technologies to provide the edge to students competing with CS graduates. In regards to the curriculum, most of it can be self taught, albeit nowhere near as fast and instructional help and networking is a plus.

Some things to note:

While the TAs are a great resource for questions, it is important to know many are App Academy graduates, so some deepter questions regarding the material may not always be provided. I believe the instructional curriculum is thorough, but there is a drop in instruction during the job search curriculum.

Overall, App Academy has been a constructive experience for me and I would recommend this bootcamp.",9/14/2018,,4.0,[],4.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy
236524,2018.0,True,"Overall, pretty good.","App academy has a curriculum that can be challenging for people with no prior experience, but it isn't impossible.  The curriculum is slightly dated, but there are several people working to update it daily.  To succeed in the course isn't hard if you are a diligent student, but you will get back how much you put in.  

There are several students have had to leave due to failing multiple tests, which is fair, and lets them know that the pace is too fast for them, or this style of learning is not appropriate for them.  a/A has been nice in terms of paying back the students. 

Pros:
- Decent curriculum that covers basic knowledge, create full stack applications, and learning the skills to learn on your own.
- Community of learners with the same goal
- Nice TAs.
- structured learning for those who need it.
- deferred payment plan.

Cons:

At times, I was completely confused and wondered if I would make it through the program in one piece, but the TAs were always extremely helpful and willing to sit down and walk us through our mistakes and logic. Almost weekly assessments may be a constant source of stress, but are totally doable if you put in the time.

Most of your time for the first 9 weeks is spent between pair programming and attending lectures. The majority of the people enrolled are fun to work with, and the TA's are always there to assist you both in person and on Slack. The entire atmosphere is quite casual yet serious. Everyone is here to get a job and everyone is aware of that. I made it in and made it all the way through with absolutely no prior coding experience (I worked in Real Estate before this). 

After the first 9 week program, there is a 3-4 week job search program that focuses on algorithms as well as job search material (cover letters, resumes, negotiations, interview skills, etc). 

You will not have a lot of free time. People in my corhort spent about 80-100 hours a week studying and completing homework/projects. However, you learn a ton from it, and it is an incredible experience.",9/13/2018,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

243475,2018.0,True,Most Fun I Never Want To Have Again,"App Academy is an incredibly fast-paced environment where concepts are thrown at you very quickly in a sink-or-swim environment. That said, the culture inherent within the program as well as the assistance provided by the TAs and practice assessments give you the tools to succeed. I commuted from Concord for the entire cohort, my average week looked like: 
M-F 
7:30am - Leave for school
9AM - Start the day 
6PM - End of Instruction
8:30PM Leave school after studying/watching videos of material, study on BART as much as possible
10PM Get Home, review everything, maybe have a beer
11PM Sleep

Sat - Study 10am - 3pm
Sun - Study 11am - 10pm

I did fairly well through the course by sticking to this schedule and thoroughly enjoyed the challenge presented by the course. That is not at all to say this is easy and that if you put in the hours you're fine; you need to be productive during that time and make sure you are maximizing your time.

For those interested in attending go ahead and apply. They will send you some material to help prepare you for the course, work through that and see how you feel. If you have fun and are hungry for more then continue with applying, if not leave it at that; software is not for everyone and thats ok. 

If you're looking for resources to practice, I recommend CodeCademy's Ruby course for a crash course on the language, then working through Project Euler, Code Wars, Code Fights, and if you're comfortable enough, LeetCode for practice problems to get you in the right mode.",9/1/2018,,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

I'm in my mid-upper 20s and I had no experience in coding at all. In fact, I don't even have a degree in any major. 
It was my absolute best choice I've made in recent years to attend a/A bootcamp prep program.
The curriculum is very well structured with step by step video explanations available as well. 
They provide A TONS  of practice problems which I strongly believe is the core factor in learning to code. (practice, practice, and practice)
The instructors are VERY caring and helpful. They are always available to help!!!

Post Course - They provide 2 Mock(practice) Tech Interviews!!!! The structure was exactly the same as the actual Tech Interview I had for a/A Full-Stack program. 
The instructors will also answer any questions and help even after course is over.
I got accepted to a/A Full-Stack Program so I am very satisfied with the a/A prep program.

- Instructors are always willing to help when you need it, but won't be babying you throughout the curriculum.
- Curriculum is structured well and by the end of the 9-weeks, you'll be able to create a full-stack application.

CONS: 
- There are a couple solo days, meaning you don't have a pair. I think there could be a couple more because some people like myself like to solidify what I know by trying it out myself.",8/23/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
244842,2018.0,True,My time at app academy ,"After college I began to become interested in learning how to code. There are a lot of free online courses out there, but it was hard for me to motivate myself to learn code on my own. I did not want to take another four years of school, so I looked into a bootcamp. I looked into a few other bootcamps, but choose App Academy because one of my friends highly recommended their program.

I pretty much started from zero knowledge about coding, and was able to finish the App Academy curriculum. Would I say I am now an expert at coding, no, but I now feel that I have a solid general understanding.

I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I would say that the two months of curriculum at App Academy was more difficult than any two months of my college career.

244617,2018.0,True,"Tough, but rewarding experience","App Academy is a great experience with lots to learn.  The program is a long 12 week program, 13 for SF,  and has you coding and interacting with others everyday from 9 am - 6 pm. In addition to the days work, you have readings and homework to prepare you for the next day making App Academy a full-time experience. While it does take up your entire life for many weeks, the programming experience is great and you definitely learn a lot. Being in an environment with others trying to achieve the same goal allows you to bounce ideas off one another which helps facilitate problem solving, depending on who you're working with. 
Pros: 
- Working with others was by-far, one of the best experiences. Being able to talk your code out with another coding individual helped me many times.
- Rewarding coding experience
- Robust coding fundamentals. The alpha curriculum preps students with the fundamentals of basic coding
- Great Staff. The TA's provide a great experience and help when you're stuck
- Bagel Day

Cons:
- Will consume your life. Be prepared for a lifestyle change
- At points, curriculum was unclear and leads to some frustration, but having others share the experience mitigates and the staff is ready to answer
-  Towards the end of the coding curriculum, there is less staff interaction or wait times will be significantly longer. However, you have students as a resource

244597,2018.0,True,App Academy,"Pros - App Academy goes over a good amount of material at a great pace - really providing us the tools to become full stack engineers in three months. I like the amount of practice we get with critical skills like React, which gives us an edge over certain candidates that may have more theoretical/backend focus. The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. I really enjoyed the work environment as well. We were pushed and challenged to be the best we could be, but also guided and not left without help.

Cons - I wish we had more time to work on our projects, but we only have a limited amount of time to cover so many things. It can definitely feel draining at times, but that's just the nature of a bootcamp. The price tag is a bit steep, but deserving with the >99% success rate. Overall no real cons - just a fast-paced curriculum that forced us to become better.

In summary, I had a really positive experience at App Academy. I'd recommend anyone trying to get into coding to give it a shot, as long as they're willing to put in the effort.",8/20/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
244596,2018.0,True,Tough but rewarding,"App Academy has been an incredible experience.  Just a handful of weeks ago, I had little to no knowledge of coding but now am proficient in Rails, CSS, HTML, and multiple JavaScript frameworks.  However, to succeed in this program, it is imperative that you commit yourself 100% to it.  That can mean giving up a lot, but as long as you are willing and able to put in the work, App Academy will give you the resources to learn more than you would think possible.  A lot of that is in part due to how they structure the course.  Most days, you will be pair programming with a partner, which creates a much more collaborative environment, in which people learn to help one another through problems.  I feel as though this was the best way possible for my own learning, as it teaches you both how to listen and interpret other's ideas and express your own clearly.  

The best advice I can give is stay on top of your work.  There is no time to catch up if you fall behind because the course moves so quickly.  The assessments are stressful, but as long as you keep up with the workload, they aren't impossible.",8/20/2018,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
231555,2018.0,True,Very rewarding,"App academy is no joke. You will spend every single day, night and day for the next 9 weeks reading new material, watching videos, doing homework and debugging, all the while drinking endless cups of coffee. You are required to check in 3 times a day (9AM, 1:30PM, and 4:00PM) or you will get a strike. 10 strikes and you're out. Overall, you will learn Ruby, SQL, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. You won't get much practice on HTML/CSS, until you get to your full stacks in week 8, where you put everything together to clone a website. For the first 7 weeks, the daily routine is basically HTML/CSS in the morning, lecture until about lunch time, then pair programming the rest of the day. The last 30 minutes are spent with your ""circle"" discussing your day. The evenings are spent on reading and watching videos on tomorrow's material and usually accompanied with basic exercises. The readings and videos will take a decent chunk of your time, so I suggest doing them ahead of time if you can. There are 6 assessments throughout the course. They tell you almost exactly what is going to be on the assessment, they give you a practice assessment, they give you a test generator to time yourself, they give you a video of a TA going through the practice assessment. Basically you shouldn't feel lost when studying up for the assessment. All the resources are there for you. When full stacks arrive on week 8, things change. No more lectures, no more circle time, and no more readings and videos. You work on your full stack all day, helping each other out when you hit bugs, giving tips to others who are doing the same or similar websites.

Some constructive criticism. The lectures, especially toward the end of the curriculum, were particularly long, and most of it was very similar to our homework that we already completed the previous night. I honestly only found those lectures useful for asking questions, but I did not feel the need to spend 2-3 more hours on the same topic we already spent hours learning for homework. The instructions for the daily projects are outstanding, providing step-by-step instructions on what you need to do next and why, that is up until around the end of week 6. Often times there will be a bulleted-list of directions telling you to implement so-and-so, when before these bulleted-list of directions would each have their own paragraph, supplemented with code snippets and explanations. In the React projects especially, they would tell you to implement something, and a few lines later, they'd provide the exact code you should write. I don't think that is helpful to our understanding. Some TAs are older and more experienced, others are recent graduates of App Academy themselves. Some are clearly better at explaining, while some kind of just look at the solutions and tell you to write what the solutions did. I'm thankful they are all trying and willing to help, but I'd always hope for certain TAs over others when hitting that ""Ask a question"" button.

All in all, it was a very rewarding experience. I've met and made many new friends. Knowing that everyone else in your cohort is going through the exact same thing is reassuring, that everyone else is sleep-deprived and feeling exhausted all the time, that if you ran into a bug that someone else will most likely have also ran into the same bug, that you have others who also committed the next 9 weeks to change their life. I've learned more at App Academy and produced more projects that I am proud of than I did in 4 years in college as a Computer Science major. If you are thinking about attending App Academy, I'd definitely recommend it. Be prepared to make some great friends, and also be prepared for some feels when your new friends drop out. There's always a few that can't handle the load.",8/20/2018,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
244591,2018.0,True,Highly recommend if you're determined,"I was a part of the NYC March cohort (Mar - Jun 2018) and purposely waited to write my review until I accepted a job after completing the program.

App Academy has changed my life; within 8 months, I quit my old non-technical job, took the course, went through interviewing and accepted a job as a software engineer (have been working for 1 month now). I think very favorably of the program overall, but want to provide some quick bullets to answer questions that I know I had when considering if App Academy was right for me:

1. How long does it take to get a job after finishing the program? 
- I feel very fortunate in that I was connected with a company with an App Academy alum at my graduation night (the final week of the program) and wrapped up my interview cycle with them in 2 weeks. This is not the norm, though. Expect your search on average to take anywhere from 4-9 months.

2. What is the average starting salary? 
- My offer was just shy of $100k at a company in New York City. Friends of mine from App Academy who have gotten jobs in the past few weeks have all been offered slightly more than me, but I hear the average range is closer to $85-90k for App Academy graduates in the New York area.

3. What are the payment plan options? 
- There are 3 choices: (1 - upfront) $17k all up front, (2 - hybrid) $9k up front and $14k in scheduled payments after accepting a job, and (3 - deferred) $5k upfront and $23k in payments after accepting a job. For #s 2 and 3, how you pay off the larger second amount depends on your starting salary; if you sign the alumni engagement agreement (you agree to mentor future students and show up at a/A events), your tuition will be capped at either 23% (hybrid) or 28% (deferred) of your starting salary and you'll pay the lower of that amount or the written amount that you owe. For example, if you accept a starting salary of $85k and you have chosen the hybrid plan, you'd only have to pay $10.55k back instead of the full $14k. Your payment schedule depends on your starting salary as well, but expect to pay between $1500 and $2000 monthly until you've paid back what you owe. If you don't accept a job after a year from when the program ends and you've been looking with a good faith effort, you get your money back. 

4. Does App Academy force me to take the first job I get? 
- No. You can choose to turn down offers that don't make sense for you, but I'm pretty sure if you do that and don't accept a job by the time the year after your program ends, you're still on the hook for tuition since you technically did get a job offer.

5. Will I feel prepared to join the workforce as a software engineer when the program is up?
- Imposter syndrome will tell you no, and that's not totally wrong. There is still so much that I want to learn about software development where I feel like I'm currently just scratching the surface. But, I do feel qualified for my current job. App Academy did a great job of teaching me both the fundamentals and how to learn things quickly that I don't know (Google is your friend! All developers, bootcamp or not, use it daily!). There's been nothing I've encountered at my job so far that I've had no idea how to handle.

6. Who are the instructors?
- The instructors are former App Academy students that most times are hired while they are still students, so they know the material very well but have not yet worked as developers outside of App Academy. The curriculum is developed by lead TAs who take the job very seriously and travel to conferences/attend meetups to make sure it is up-to-date and relevant.

7. Who will my classmates be?
- Students seem to vary in their backgrounds. Expect a cohort in NYC to be around 40 people though, and maybe 5 of them will have a CS degree. Closer to 1/3 might have previous light coding experience (SQL, basic JavaScript) from another job. 

8. What languages will I learn and are they useful in the job market?
- App Academy will teach you Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS as languages. More specifically, you'll learn Rails as a backend framework and React/Redux as frontend libraries to help you render web pages. Ruby is not used heavily anymore but is a great semantic starter language to help teach you how to code. React, from what I've seen, is where job demand is right now. My current team uses React.

9. Is it really possible to be successful in this program with no coding background?
- Yes. I had no coding background. That being said though, it takes a lot of work and determination to get up to speed. I did the JumpStart program through a/A which taught me coding basics for free after work over 4 weeks. Then once I was accepted, I meticulously when through the pre-cohort prep course (alpha course) before beginning classes. Take alpha seriously and make sure you understand it thoroughly; there's office hours for your questions.

10. Cons?
- It's a stressful environment where you can fail out if you don't pass 2 of the weekly exams. There are only 6 exams total so they don't last for your whole time in the program, but they are very high stress and require a strong ability to focus and mitigate any anxiety that this may induce for you. The prep resources are there to help you (there are always practice exams for you to take and TAs will occasionally have test walk-throughs to attend before the assessments) but you need to put the work in to succeed. My one complaint about App Academy is there is still room for improvement for how TA's provide emotional support to students who do not handle stress well. If that is you, you can still do this program - don't be discouraged! But you will have to go out of your way to ask for emotional support and feedback from your TAs and peers.",8/20/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
244590,2018.0,True,Your life will change,"Your life will change (super cliché/corny, I know, but it’s kind of true) after finishing this program. Especially if you don't have any technical background, like myself. 

As for the prepwork that App Academy provides, the curriculum isn’t as well developed as it could be, and you’re going to run into a lot of frustration with realizing that the things you need to learn to do some of the exercises are covered in later chapters or that in the later chapters. I recommend going out of your way to look up your own documentation of the concepts introduced in the Alpha Course Curriculum. Chris Pine’s Intro to Ruby free online course helped me a lot in that regard, you can google it but I believe App Academy should have also linked you to that resource. 

The program is intense, even for people with cs degrees. People with background will definitely catch up concepts faster and some will be a review for them.  But it doesn't mean its not hard for them. As a someone without tech background, came to aA everyday including weekends to study. They are not lying about 100 hours per week of studing time. for the first 9 weeks, I've never slept more than 6 hours. 
This is my personal case, some people can study only 70~80 hours and still do super well. 

This program is NOT for everyone. You really have to be passionate to learn how to program. Even if you are, this style of learning may not be for you. I personally loved it and enjoyed every moment of it. I strongly recommend to everyone, but please take everyone's warning very seriously. This is one of the hardest coding bootcamp.",8/19/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
244561,2018.0,True,Learned a lot,"This is the best place to go to if you need to learn a lot about coding in a short amount of time. It is definitely challenging but also rewarding when you get to full stack projects. The more I learn, the more I figure out that there is a lot I don't know about.  But App Academy will teach you the fundamentals to learn other aspects of coding much quicker.",8/19/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
244576,2018.0,True,App Academy Review,"App Academy is an incredibly rewarding experience — I've been attending the program in SF for 9 weeks, and just finished the first section of the course, and I can't even describe how much I've enjoyed it. We've learned Ruby, SQL, Javascript, React, Redux, Rails, and completed a full-stack clone of an existing application. There are people of all ages and backgrounds here. The youngest being 17 (by a pretty wide margin), and the oldest 40+. There are quite a few CS majors, but also people with engineering, accounting, sales, etc. backgrounds. However, the gender ratio for this cohort was pretty bad: about 1/12 are female. There are definitely people who are a lot better at coding from the start than others, which may change over the course of the program, so be prepared for that.

In my opinion, these are the two most incredible parts of a/A:
1. How much you learn, and how fast you learn it. The workload is intense (see below), but you'll amaze yourself with how capable you are of absorbing it! 
2. The people. The TA's are very intelligent and genuinely want to help you succeed. The culture is not competitive at all. Everyone supports each other. We help one another with bugs, explain concepts to those who are struggling, get lunch together, and generally have a good time while coding. This community is actually very important, especially considering that we spend at least 45 hours together/week.

When you apply and pass the interviewing process, you must complete an Alpha Course — essentially a pretty packed curriculum on the basics of Ruby and Object Oriented Programming. a/A recommends that you spend 4 weeks on this, which is definitely a good idea. However, completely it in less than that time is doable if you can fully commit all your time to doing it. I finished in less than 2 weeks, although I had some prior programming experience in Java. I also spent nearly the entirety of every day working on it. 

Each day during the first section of the actual course looked pretty much the same, save the material we learned that day: 9am start, lecture for around 2 hours, then pair program for the rest of the day to practice the material taught in lecture, with a break for lunch and a brief one in the afternoon. After the school day is over, we do 1-3 hours of homework. The homework consists of readings/videos and a small assignment that cover the material for the next day, which will be reviewed during the lecture. This is why a/A is definitely a full-time commitment — really try to keep up, and this is totally doable if you are sufficiently motivated and allocate your time wisely. At first, it was pretty difficult to adjust to this schedule: my eyes would be really sore by Thursday of each week for the first 3 weeks, and there are no windows so it's a little stifling. However, by the end of that, I was fully adapted.

There are a total of 6 assessments spread across the first 8 weeks, and if you fail twice, and then fail a retake, you are kicked out, no exceptions. This is a really strict policy, and it's definitely a lot of pressure. About 25% of the people in my cohort were kicked out, so please consider this carefully. I failed the third assessment, and was really stressed for the rest, but passed them without a problem. These assessments really are not designed to get you or anything like that. They provide practice assessments, and as long as you do those until you can finish it in about half the time you get for the real assessment, you will be totally fine. Just make sure you understand the material — don't simply memorize!

There were many times where I felt completely lost, but the TA staff at App Academy was always super accommodating and willing to patiently teach any of us that needed the help. I can't thank them enough for the help they gave me every time I felt ready to give up. If you are willing to drop everything and commit 9 weeks to see if coding is for you, there isn't a program out there I'd recommend more so than App Academy.",8/18/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
244450,2018.0,True,App Academy,"Quick disclaimer- I just finished the course, so I don't have a job yet. I'll just talk about the experience I have to this point. 

The way the curriculum works is that you have 9 weeks of  the learning curriculum. You learn Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, SQL, and more. You also create your full-stack project.
The next 3 weeks is the career curriculum. Here they teach you what you need to do to get a job, and what you should expect. During this time, you create a javascript project.

First off let me say, it is a difficult program. When they say 100 hours/week, it's literally 100 hours per week. It is a pretty hard thing to get used to. Also, during the first 9 weeks, there are 6 assessments that you have to pass. If you don't pass 2, your out. So kind of harsh. However, at the end of it, it's a really accomplished feeling.
I would recommend planning on not having a life for the 3 months you are in the program. 

We had really great TA's to teach us the curriculum and help us with all our questions. The support that they give is really great! It's crazy how much you can learn in just 12 weeks!

At the end of the 12 weeks, you have 2-3 projects, a personal website, a resume, linkedin profile etc etc. They make sure you have everything in order for you to get a job.
I just graduated so I don't know if how prepared we are, but all in all, it was a great experience.",8/10/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
232161,2018.0,True,"Amazing, but nowhere near perfect","You know when you were a kid and you kind of thought your parents or grown ups had everything figured out? And then you grow up to realize they're pretty much winging it? Elements of App Academy feel a bit like that.

To be clear, I really enjoyed App Academy and thought it was about as good as one could do trying to teach this amount of material in a very condensed period of time. But I don't think aA should remain complacent because there is definitely room for improvement. For instance, when you first arrive, you learn a bit about the TAs, some of whom may have just graduated from aA the week before. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but you do see a big disparity between TAs who have more experience and those that are hot off the presses for lack of a better term. This becomes more obvious the more you ask about topics that are tangentially related to the curriculum. I think the TAs on average tend to nail topics related to every day's projects, but if you're looking for a resource to widen your understanding of some technologies you may find yourself slightly disappointed depending on who you ask. 

The next element I took issue with is the check-in structure. I want to emphasize this: bootcamp students are adult humans. App Academy has a thrice daily check-in (by 9, 1:10-1:130, 3:55-4:00) that must be done on their internet to confirm that you're there. On one hand--I get it because we do pair programming for most of the day and missing out on the pairing screws over your partner for the day. On the other hand, we don't need to be treated like elementary school students and should be given at least a LITTLE more license over our education. This isn't likely to change anytime soon, so if it seems overbearing to you, keep that in mind.

Assessments. The assessments are necessary but flawed... one one hand, you need to make sure students are really keeping up with their understanding of the material because if you don't understand each week or day's subject matter, you're setting yourself up for failure in the coming weeks. That said, the assessments aren't so dynamic that you can't just read the specs, learn the patterns, and pass the assessments without fundamentally understanding the core concepts. All this is to say that students that don't have a great understanding of the material can sneak through the system by memorizing patterns needed for assessments. I think they could stand to be recalibrated.

The curriculum is excellent but the project instructions vary pretty drastically from day to day. Some days the projects feel clear as day and the instructions step through the material in a way that puts you and your partner in the driver's seat giving you the appropriate amount of hints/code. Other days the instructions feel really really open ended and make far too many assumptions about our prior knowledge. 

I could continue to nitpick details about App Academy,  but at the end of the day, the students are bright, motivated, and the environment is extremely positive and supportive. While the work load at times can feel overwhelming, the TAs and your fellow students are always there to help. I would recommend App Academy to just about anybody looking to quickly get from 0 to 100 as a web developer and I would encourage aA to never stop improving.",8/10/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

The real stress kicks in week 10 when the training wheels are officially removed. You are forced to complete not only a full-stack web application, but a javascript browser game and a code intensive while preparing yourself for the job search.  I am in no way ready to start a career as a software developer but App Academy definitely gave me the tools I need to continue learning and preparing for a job I actually want.

As a whole I reallly loved my time at app academy. I had a great cohort and great instructors. Everyone is very helpful an encouraging, but there will be no handhoding. You wil be thrown in and encouraged to learn and teach yourself a good amout. This is a good thing as those skills will become paramount in being able to learn more as you go. 

My background was not in anything even slightly related to coding in any way. I found the program challenging throughout and sometimes even felt like i could not mae it through. Alas i did so thats good. Be aware that when they say you will be spending 90-100 hours a week working this is not an exageration. I thought it like was but for the first 10 weeks all we did was eat sleep code rinse repeat.

The jib search curriculum was also very good in my estimation. It is hard to assign it an actual value since I just started the job appliatio process, but i do feel i have learned a lot and polished up my professional look online.

If youre willing to dedicae yourself to this 100% for the duration I would highly recommend this program. I have no real basis of comparison as it is te only one i attended but I cant say I have any regrets in choosing this bootcamp over any other.

244043,2018.0,True,Glad I chose this path,"I'm really glad I made this decision to change careers and to attend App Academy.

The structure during the technical curriculum (weeks 1-10) can be taken for granted easily, because a completely new, but equally (if not more) stressful challenge arose once we moved over to the less structured job search curriculum. 

Much of going through this program is self-directed and self-taught, with guidance from the readings, lectures, projects, and homework. The instructors are not as hands-on with the students as some may expect, but they are available for questions at all times. This should be taken advantage of to the fullest. The assessments are extremely challenging and stressful, as if you fail to pass two of them, you are dismissed from the program. Be ready to feel behind, feel stressed, question multiple times your decision of choosing this path, but be ready to also enjoy coming in everyday, and feeling like this was the best decision you've made for your career so far.

244029,2018.0,True,It's so much more than a coding bootcamp.,"App Academy is an incredible coding bootcamp. I came into the bootcamp with many expectations of what it might be like but I never could have imagined what I have experienced so far. 

To start, the learning environment is positive, supportive, and encouraging. App Academy constantly reinforces a culture of collaboration, pair programming, and sharing knowledge. The best example (and my favorite aspect of the program as a whole) are the TAs and instructional staff. These are mainly past graduates who have decided to help new students find their way through the intense 9 week curriculum. Because they have been through the program themselves they know what the students are going through, and do an amazing job of providing support when needed - be it technical help on a tough coding problem, or providing some much needed reassurance when the grind becomes real - they really do care and will spend hours (literally) with you until you understand a concept comfortably.

Speaking of the grind, App Academy will test you. But that’s what a bootcamp is meant to do. Sleepless nights, hours of homework reading and problems (after 9 hours of coding), and weekly assessments will push you to your mental and physical limits. You will experience moments where the last thing you want to do is write another line of code, or spend another hour trying to debug your program. The most important thing is to keep on trying, and ask for help when you need it. The support system is there for you to take advantage of, and everyone is happy to help.

But it’s not all bad. In fact, there is so much more that is good about this bootcamp. For as much stress and frustration you will go through, you will experience twice the amount of achievement, learning, and moments of triumph. You will learn to build so many cool things and come away with the confidence to continue learning on your own afterward. You will build new and deep friendships with classmates going through the same struggle and grind. The alumni community at App Academy is healthy, growing, and super friendly.  

If you are thinking about App Academy, I highly recommend it. This bootcamp is has not only been an opportunity for me to step into the tech industry as a software developer, it has been a challenging experience that I can look back on with gratitude and pride.",7/12/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
232079,2018.0,True,Fast-Paced but Rewarding,"Enrolling in AppAcademy was a chance for me to switch careers and I do not regret it. At the end of the day, it really is what you make of it. I did a lot of research on web-development and delved around in multiple free curriculums such as freeCodeCamp and TheOdinProject prior but it was hard to keep myself accountable. Due to the massive amounts of tutorials and references available through open source, I found it hard to make serious progress as I would jump from language to language, not sure of what I should learn with the limited time that I had. AppAcademy provided me structure and forced me to be disciplined and I was able to make massive progress in 3 months, much more than I ever did when I was self-studying and not fully immersing myself.

I would say that most of the knowledge is picked up through pair programming. Having to work with another partner daily during the curriculum really sharpened my understanding of not only the material but my ability to articulate it to other people. You'll also learn a lot when you help your cohort mates debug and vice versa. The curriculum is very fast-paced and it is amazing how fast you feel that you can fall behind in only a day. The React/Redux portion was probably the most challenging week in the curriculum as new material is just piled onto you.

Our cohort is currently in the job search curriculum so I cannot comment at the moment regarding the job search. Needless to say, I am looking forward to opening up this new chapter in my career.

To answer some questions that I had when I was making the decision to enroll:
- The language you learn doesn't matter. Once you are familiar with how web-development works, you realize that there are similar patterns/conventions that are fundamental to each language. Different programming languages can all achieve the same means.
- Make sure you enroll ahead of the months notice that they tell you to. You do have pre-curriculum prep that you have to do before the cohort that requires at least two weeks of time. I personally went through the prep work twice before my cohort started as well as learning as much JavaScript as I could. This goes a long way between determining how stressed you feel during the lecture part of the curriculum when you're learning new materials everyday.
-  I did a good amount of problems on CodeWars and CodeFights and LeetCode during my preparation for the application. While it helped me learn how to problem solve, web development is actually a totally different beast! Don't get discouraged if you struggle at these tricky word problems because it doesn't mean that you can't build killer apps.

The curriculum as a whole is fantastic and reinforces your understanding through a variety of methods: readings, videos, homework, lectures, group discussions, and most importantly actually putting into practice your new skills throughout each day.

After completing the main coding curriculum as well as a few major projects, I've become confident in my ability to code and build full-stack and frontend apps in Rails, React/Redux, JavaScript, etc. It's also inspired me to want to pick up new stacks and tools. I've definitely learned more over these past 3 months than any other 3 month (or even 1 year) period of time.

I can't speak to those without technical backgrounds. But even though I had some previous programming experience, it didn't really matter since everything was new to me after the second week.

One of my favorite thing about the program is that is practical in nature, so be prepared to experience a non-traditional yet more efficient approach to education in which you'll learn by doing and collaborating with others. By the end of the program, you'll have an amazing portfolio of projects that will impress any hiring manager. And even after you are done as a student, you'll still benefit from the amazing career support App Academy  provides and you'll have access to the incredible network of App Academy alumni.

Be prepared to spend 10-12 hours a day studying, 7 days a week for the first 9 weeks. Although there were many stressful days and sleepless nights, the amount of knowledge you accrue throughout the curriculum period is crazy. One of the aspects that I really liked at app academy was just being able to surround yourself around incredibly talented individuals, who are all working towards the same goal as you. It really fosters an environment that allows you to push yourself further.

A typical day at App Academy during the curriculum period consists of checking in at 9am, lecture, pair programming, and flex time, which is pretty much a circle time where you discuss with your designated group about what you learned that day. Some of the TAs were previous students and were very approachable, though at times during pair programming, none are on the floor/available. There are lecture videos and homework  you are tasked to watch and complete every night, which usually take a few hours to complete. Assessments are given almost every week during the curriculum period and they require tons of studying. Be prepared to simply eat, sleep, code, repeat.

243968,2018.0,True,Great if you're looking to change careers and would like to get your foot in the door,"If you are serious about a career change to software development, then I would recommend you go to App Academy. Before the course, I did not know too much about coding coming from a background in science and doing some self learning. In the short amount of time, I probably learned more than a year's worth of self studying. 

For the first 8 weeks, you are going to be going to a/A and getting a lecture in the morning and then coding until 5:30PM with some exceptions. After that, you will have homework, which includes assignments, readings, videos, which generally take about 1-3 hours in the earlier weeks and going up to 5 hours as you progress through the course.

You spend your first 2-3 weeks, going over Ruby to practice/learn coding fundamentals. The next 3 weeks are spent learning SQL and Ruby on Rails, where you can create your first website! After creating your website, you learn JavaScript for about a week and then React/Redux to learn how to improve your website. I honestly wish more time was spent on the JavaScript portion of the curriculum, but at this point everything is moving along even faster. You spend weeks 8-9 creating a clone of a website like Instagram, SoundCloud, Facebook ect. This is probably the first time where you are actually building a project from scratch to finish and its great once you accomplished it! However up until you finish, it will most likely be a struggle and a big learning experience.

After that is done, you get to move to the job search portion, where you build another solo project and a group project of your choice, which was also pretty fun/struggle! During this time you also learn and work on skills not related to coding such as resumes, cover letters, salary negotiations. After that you have around two weeks to work on learning algorithms, which are key to getting a job. You pretty much self learn/have limited help during this time and you basically set your own schedule more or less.

Overall App Academy is great for getting introducing you to being a software developer. You should be fine if you put in the work. The assessments you take are similar to the practice ones they give you. Depending on how fast you learn/study, you might have some time off on Fridays and maybe a couple hours on the weekend to relax and do whatever you want.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering and thought that was pretty difficult. My degree did not aid in any kind of way with getting through this program. 

My daily schedule consisted of starting class at 9 AM and go to sleep at 1 AM/2 AM. There are homework and readings every night. Rinse and repeat. Don't be scared though. Anyone can get through this program if you work hard. Don't give up. Ask yourself at the end of each day if you did everything absolutely possible to understand it. We all learn at different rates, do what you need to. Oh yeah, try to get some sleep...haha

You really will need to spend upward of 85 hours a week on your studies if you want to be successful, but if you have the time and the discipline then don't be scared away. I've had very, very little free-time over the past months, but in exchange I've gained an extremely valuable skill in less time than I could have imagined before beginning the program.

The instructors are top-notch. Everything in general is conducted extremely professionally, from the location and the building/amenities (I attended the NY branch), to the assessments and the projects. Before joining the program I was under the impression that I could have learned all of the same skills on my own, using free resources online. Looking back now, this miiiiight be possible, but it honestly would have taken me more than 10 times as long to do alone. Having the instructors on call, and the other students as pair-programmers was indispensable for me. Again, the program is totally worth it for those who are serious about becoming full-stack developers. I just recently accepted an offer as a frontend developer thanks to App Academy.

243887,2018.0,True,Advice to people that want to apply,"So I am writing this review while still in Job search curriculum at App Academy and I just wanted to give some advice to people that want to apply. First, LEARN TO CODE before you apply. I spent two years learning Java and CS topics like data structures and algorithms in Foothill college. That helped me to understand concepts of programming while preparing for coding challenge and later in the program. This doesn't mean you have to spend two years, but few months of intense learning will help a lot, and I would also strongly recommend to take Ruby course on Codecademy or similar website. Second thing, if you get accepted to JumpStart, don't just do homework problems and think this is enough. This is huge mistake. You should do a t least three times more than homework. Many people that relied only on homework failed to pass JumpStart assessments. Third thing, WORK HARD. The curriculum in A/a is designed the way that you WILL NOT have free weekend. Every weekend you will have stuff to work on. It's very easy to fall behind. Overall the school is great and gives you practical knowledge to be a junior dev. Course also covers general CS concepts like data structures and teaches you algorithms towards the end of the course. Every day you are required to leave you feedback about instructors, and they read those reviews and take steps to improve   program.",7/3/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

The assessments can be stressful, as there is a threat of getting kicked out. But it motivated me to take the assessments seriously and study hard. 
We also do 3 projects (1 full stack, 1 pure javascript project and 1 game), that helps seal gaps in our learning. I have just started the job search curriculum, and will update my review once I find a job.",7/3/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

243794,2018.0,True,Two words: Worth It!!,"BACKGROUND:

Network Engineering / IT background (5 years) but always had an interest in coding. Prior to this class the only coding experience I had was from an Intro to Programming college class 6 years ago.


COURSE PACE / MATERIAL

Compared to a 3 month Introductory to Programming class offered at a college, this is a one month course. But you’ll learn more in the one month than an entire semester in a traditional college setting. The class meets for two and a half hours a day, five days a week for four weeks. Expect to start the first day with a two and half hour lecture. 
Overall the course was very well paced and clearly delivers coding foundations and basics. I made the mistake of falling behind which led the first two weeks being very challenging. Assignments are given out every day so prepare to spend extra time outside of class (1 to 2hrs/day) coding and learning. Lesson notes are provided as text as well as video walk through which was VERY helpful. You can also ask the instructors for help if needed, they were always available after class. 
As far as learning enough to get accepted into a top bootcamp: the class offers a money back guaranteed so you really can’t lose out. I do feel that graduated who spend time practicing after the course will have a very good shot at making it into top bootcamps. 

INSTRUCTORS / NON-TECHNICAL BENEFITS
This was what made the class worth it for me. Usually when you talk to someone (especially an instructor that works for a bootcamp) you’ll notice they’re trying to sell you something. That wasn’t the case here. I had a TON of questions about working in coding, surviving the 100hour/week main bootcamp, what the job market was like for graduates of a full time bootcamp, what can cause someone to fail, etc.. The Bootcamp Prep instructors (Alvin and David) were very honest and accommodating.
For the first time I felt like I was getting real and genuine answers. Alvin and David were very patient and didn’t sugar coat anything. The info they gave really helped solidify my desire to go into software engineering and allowed me to plan and prepare accordingly to attend a full time bootcamp in the future.

I had to take another admittance test—which at first they forgot to process—and then was finally accepted into a cohort the following fall. And then the real work started. I’ll second anyone who says they didn’t sleep much. It’s mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting. I failed my third assessment by 1 Point so I spent the second half of my cohort terrified that if I failed again my time at appAcademy would be over. But I did it. I made it through to the end. I made full stack web applications. I made a game in javascript. I learned new technologies like React. I got a job in a field I had ZERO experience in a year ago. In addition to all the technical assets I learned at appAcademy, I also became better at believing in myself. You’ll learn a lot here.

By the time I went to the course I was coding in C, Java, and Python, yet even though a lot of the information was a repeat (over again for each language) the experience itself made me love coding even more and I could not have made a better decision! My teacher Alvin and the T.A. David were incredible, not only in the class but also out of class and after the course ended.  It was great to work and learn amongst friendly and diverse people from various fields who were not my competitors but my teammates.

243700,2018.0,True,My Accelerated Life,"Throughout my entire life, I have gone through accelerated courses whether it be the military or my undergrad. App Academy was no joke and it definitely gave me the whooping I deserved to make me humble to the vast amount of knowledge I was about to face and understand that I'll be a lifelong student in the world of tech. The reason why I decided on App Academy were their tuition model and reputation for being one of the best.

Needless to stay, they delivered. The curriculum consistently got more difficult and ranged from technical to soft skills. Both of which I receive valuable training in but I believe the soft skills are where I improved the most. I have always been the type of person to work alone. It was fine up until the halfway mark in which I realized I couldn't be in the world of tech working alone as there will never be enough time to learn and keep up with the lastest trends in technologies.

tl;dr
App Academy taught me:
    1. Technical skills to get through the door
    2. Soft skills to land the job
    3. How to learn and do my own research
    4. To strive to become a mentor",6/22/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

But at the start of the eighth week began doing our full stack project. The end result is what was the most satisfying. I was proud of what I made and my friends and family were amazed on how practical the teaching was, enough to make a full stack app. The course is super rewarding. I am currently on the 10th week and our job search curriculum is about to begin and am super excited to start working soon!",6/16/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
237536,2018.0,True,"Web focus. As expected, very intense.","I chose to attend App Academy because of its reputation of being very difficult, and it certainly is that. It's kind of like those videos of parents throwing their babies into the pool, and then helping them turn their heads so they float on their backs. Seems extremely harsh, and the babies don't know what to do at first, but they quickly figure it out because they have to.

My background: I had a little programming experience coming in - I built an app and put it on the Play Store, among other small projects. That being said, it too me 5 attempts, using Ruby, to get in. 

APPLICATION PROCESS

There was 1 small coding challenge, then 1 remote interview via Skype (which I had two chances at), which I didn't pass, so I was referred to a ""JumpStart"" program to help me get up to speed, roughly 3 hours per night during the week at App Academy. Again, 2 chances to pass part 1 (which I already had) or part 2. I didn't pass either of them, although it was close. Then I was told there was one more opportunity at a remote technical interview via Skype, which I jumped at, and finally passed. Then, one more non-technical ""fit"" interview which was just like a normal job interview, and then I was in.

ONCE YOU'RE IN
There is a lot of front loaded information before you even start your first day. It's called the ""Alpha Curriculum."" It goes over Ruby basics, helps you get your machine environment setup, and you build little projects to prepare you. Near the end you build something like Battleship and I think it runs in the terminal. Takes about 100 total hours to complete the Alpha Curriculum.

DAY TO DAY EXPERIENCE
For the first 8 weeks, you're paired with someone to program with. All day, every day. You switch ""driving"" and ""navigating"" roles every 15 minutes. One of you is meant to guide the direction of the code, and the other to implement it. There is a strike system in place meant to keep you present and on task, 10 strikes and you're dismissed from App Academy. There are also 6 assessments that you need to pass. If you fail twice, you're also dismissed (you get a single retry on your second fail). It seems harsh, but the content you learn builds heavily on previous content.

How a normal week day looks:
1-3 hours of lecture
5-7 hours of pair programming
1 hour lunch
2-4 hours of homework (consisting of reading, videos - shorter if you watch on 2x speed, coding exercises)

How a weekend looks:
12-20 hours of preparation for assessments. Usually a sample assessment is released, which you are expected to grind over during the weekend, in addition to 2-3 hours of homework for Monday.

WHAT YOU LEARN
Basically you're learning web technologies. Ruby and Rails for the backend, JavaScript, React, and Redux for the frontend. After 8 weeks of pair programming is complete, you start your first stack project, and complete it in 10 days. For example, this was mine: https://infinotes.herokuapp.com/

After the full stack project, there is a JavaScript project, and lastly a ""flex"" project that you're expected to complete with a team. These last two projects take place during the job search portion of the course, when you work on resumes, interview skills, and algorithms.

If web technologies if what you're looking for, and I'm told that it translates well to other fields, then you'll definitely learn it here.

I don’t feel as though I have learned enough to get into the bootcamp but I do feel like I have a stronger grip on what to learn and can continue to get ready for the bootcamp. I am a perfectionist though and know a lot of my classmates feel like they are ready and passed all the problems on the last assessment. The instructor was encouraging and I really appreciated what I learned from him. Alvin didn’t get frustrated with my struggles and didn’t give up on me despite how discouraged I felt. He tought us how to think like a developer and to problem solve instead of memorizing code and that is really important. When I couldn’t get a problem to pass he would go through and debug with me.

I thought the course was easy and i really didn't learn much, but when i looked back, I was able to  understand, talk about, and do ALOT more than i was ever before, which means that they actually taught me a whole bunch WHILE getting the ""new-to-coding"" classmates. 

By the end of class, i think everyone was well taught on their fundamentals and ready to tackle their technical interview, which.. the prep course also helps you out by offering mock interviews and follow up.

236406,2018.0,True,App Academy Bootcamp Prep (and my experience paying for other courses),"Background : I have a finance background, and had absolutely no idea on how to code, or even open up a terminal. We can say that I was as green to coding as anyone could be. 

Pre-work : As soon as I paid for the course, I was immediately given access to the Github with all the material, including problem sets, videos, and assessments. For one week, I worked through all the work up until mid-week 2, which I would recommend anyone do if they would like to be more prepared than their peers and feel less lost (that will happen regardless if you're new to all of this). My instructor emailed me consistently, and even helped me through the initial phases of just knowing where to type.

Instructor : Coding people have a (IMO deserved) reputation of not being the best communicators. This was what scared me most about transitioning my career. I did not want to be at the mercy of someone who is crass and can't communicate with people. The instructor, Alvin, and his TA, David, were by far the best people anyone could ask for when it came to teaching the class. Alvin responds to emails usually in less than one hour (if I message him on Slack, far quicker of course), and the way he teaches, there is no way someone can fall behind. Each line of code is explained in bitter detail until everyone has a positive look on their face.

Material : VIDEO WALKTHROUGHS. for every single problem on the homework or assessment, Alvin made videos walking through each one. I now have access to those walkthroughs for life on Github. If you are new to coding, these walkthroughs are your lifeblood. You can easily learn everything you need to know without stepping foot in a classroom if you have a good walkthrough for a problem set. These walkthroughs are thorough, and I used them for interview prep extensively. 

Competition: I was lucky(un-lucky) enough to have some extra cash to spend to seal the deal on nailing the technical interviews. I decided to enroll in Hack Reactor's prep course. I chose the premium prep option in which I was given a mentor who would design a curriculum based on my level of knowledge. I really just wanted technical interview questions so I could review them with my mentor. When I signed up, I knew fairly quickly this wasn't going to be App Academy. In order to get answers to questions as a premium prepper, I had to submit it in a certain format on a certain site, etc. When you have a question to a problem, the last thing you want is to have to go through the process of submitting it for review (and waiting 24-48 hours). The course itself was actually free, so i actually only paid for the submission of the code.My mentor, who was already uncomfortable with me just wanting to do the technical interview prep, wanted me initially to start off at ground 0 learning what a variable was. After a prickly conversation, I moved on to a video session with him. Very knowledgeable guy, I just probably wouldn't put him as the mentor to receive people at first. I asked for a refund, and received one very quickly from the very nice people there. I think Hack Reactor is a strong tiered school, but their bootcamp prep approach differs from App Academy. I can promise you, as a ground 0 student, pay the extra money and go to a/A. 

This is not the only experience. My business partner left his job at the same time as I did, and enrolled in Galvanize Bootcamp Prep. Galvanize has a course in which they don't even give you solutions to problems! He quickly had to leave because there were no problem reviews, and the instructor had never done the problems himself. I kid you not, he refused to answer how to do an isEven function, and instead said to ""think about how to do it"". You will never pass a technical interview with not repeatedly doing problems.

Conclusion : I can't speak to full bootcamps, the other camps I mentioned have extremely strong track records of success at their full camps, and I would be lucky to get into their immersive programs. That being said, no one has put more effort into their prep than Bootcamp Prep at a/A. If you go to their course and do the work, you will be ahead of the curve come interview time.

Long: AppAcademy has been a whirlwind of a learning experience. I came in with some prior experience coding, but not enough to do anything with. Before I got accepted into the actual program I spent about 2 months preparing by learning ruby, in part with their JumpStart program, which I strongly suggest if they ask you to join - it's free compared to the Bootcamp Prep, but isn't as in-depth from what I hear. Take the AlphaCourse really seriously - don't approach it with the attitude of ""it only takes x hours to finish, I'll wait until x hours before it's due!"" because that's the mentality that gets you failing out of the program.

The curriculum has been worked over by a lot of people and on the whole is very solid and thorough, but at times can be hard to follow if you don't understand the style it is being conveyed to you in. That said, after 9 weeks of the curriculum, I made a fully functioning, albeit slightly bare-bones, website which completely blew my mind to see the progress I made. This accomplishment is just as much due to my own abilities as it is to the curriculum, institution, and the teachers they employe here.

10/10 would suggest, but I need at least a solid week of rest following this. Be ready to put in a minimum of 10 hour days and 60 hour weeks - anything less is a fleeting luxury. When you get to the cap-stone project you get 10 days, expect to work those 10 days straight and put a minimum of 100 hours into your project.",5/21/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.5,[],5.0,4.0,,app-academy
239786,2018.0,True,A great course for those who are prepared,"App Academy is a great place to further your knowledge in programming and the curriculum is very rich with information that if you master them, I can say that you'll do very well as a web developer. However, this doesn't mean that you'll become proficient from just attending the course. The course will only prepare you for what a work environment will be like and the rest is up to you. Self-studying and personal projects on the side is what will help you grow after graduating. 
Here are things for people intending to attend App Academy or are already accepted: 
1. The 90+ hours of studying per week is real. You really have to study every night and do the hw to be prepared for next day's work.
2. I can't stress this enough, master the alpha course that they give you when you are accepted. A lot of people fail out because they didn't take it seriously.
3. If you really are a true beginner when it comes to coding as in you know nothing, really ask yourself: ""Do I learn really quickly and if not am I really going to put in the work to make up for that? "" 
I started the program after learning Ruby for 3 weeks, and I can tell you that not having a background in coding really harmed my learning experience at App Academy. I was able to survive the course, but wasn't able to absorb as much of the curriculum as I originally intended to. 
4. They are not kidding about failing 2 assessments and kicking you out. The assessments are a great way to gauge if you on track but for those who have testing-anxiety a single bug on the examine can mean life  or death. I want to say that if you studied enough, then you'll do fine but there days when you might not be able to find that bug because it's as simple as a spelling typo. 
Final advice it to just stay on top of your game, assessments are important but don't prioritize it over studying for the week's material. 

Lastly, The most important question of all: Is this really what you want to do with your whole life? Are you willing to throw everything away for a minimum of three months to get it?",5/21/2018,,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
235275,2018.0,True,"It was LIT. As in, lit a fire under my-- watch yo mouth.","Just finished the curriculum part of App Academy. It was intense, grueling, and sleep-deprived, but I would do it all over again. I have learned so much and went from being an absolute beginner with no coding experience whatsoever to where I can call myself an software engineer (still have so much to learn though lol). They have a great and intense curriculum (it has to be that way for you to go from 0-100 real quick), and they have a great and talented staff of teachers that will lead, mold, consult, and be there with you every step of the way. They are smart people, people. You  in good hands.

If you are someone who wants to change the direction of your life or want to get into programming for whatever reason, AND above all else is willing to put in the hours to do it, do not hesitate and go for it. You won't regret it.

235186,2018.0,True,App Academy Review,"App Academy has definitely been the most rigorous academic program I ever attended. The pros for this program is the ability to learn so much information in such a short span. Most of the time you will feel like you are overwhelmed with knowledge to the point where you feel like you'll forget the material when it comes to applying it later. To my (and many other students') surprise, applying your knowledge will feel like second nature.

The biggest drawback is the assessments and the consequences of failing these assessments. People spent large sums of money, left their jobs and invested their time for App Academy. To know that you can be let go if you're at risk creates a high level of anxiety. I personally left my job and was on the brink of failing from the program. Knowing how much I sacrificed to only be let go and not have a job to go back to is a serious problem. It's great that I passed through, but my situation would have been completely different if I was kicked out for academic reasons.",5/20/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],3.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
242364,2018.0,True,Great leap into software development,"App Academy's curriculum is absolutely fantastic. It is rigorous and often stressful, but you learn at such an accelerated rate (relative to self learning or the like) that I think it's definitely worth the time if you can afford it. A lot of that is due to the excellent instructional readings and videos provided to you, as well as the amazing help from your instructors. You learn full stack web development with a back-end in Ruby on Rails, which may not be the hottest thing out there right now, but by the end of the course you will be skilled enough to be able to transition to any other back-end framework of you or your future employer's choosing. The instructors teach you not only about the frameworks, such as Rails, but also about how they work under the hood, which is great to really cement your understanding of core concepts and build your foundation. I'm also a fan of their weekly assessments, which are a great way to gauge how well you're doing in the course up to that point. The material on these is extremely fair relative to what you learn in class on a daily basis, and they are a great way to sharpen your test taking and pressure handling ability. 

The people of App Academy, in my experience, are all really great. At least in my cohort, everyone got along beautifully. I can't say this is always going to be true, but I trust in App Academy's hiring process enough to think it should be true for future cohorts as well. 

Although the curriculum is very rewarding, it is also very demanding. If you want to excel, you will most likely need to dedicate most, if not all of your time to this course. Though the assessments are fair, you will need to spend a lot time studying for them. Don't be afraid to ask for help! You will get what you put in.

Having yet been hired I cannot attest to the primary goal of the program which is their ability to get you a job, however I will say that I'm confident of doing so. If you're a self-starter and have people in your network that can help you land that first job, you might be able to succeed without the program.

You will be surrounded by other motivated and smart individuals (ensured by a rigorous selection process), and if you are also motivated, you will succeed. It is quite amazing to see people come in with minimal programming experience, and come out able to make really good looking web applications using several different technology stacks. Looking back, this is definitely something that I, and probably most people wouldn't be able to achieve by themselves within 3 months

241983,2017.0,True,Great way to break into Software Development.,"Pros:
- Intense nature of program keeps you engaged throughout and focuses on actually coding.
- Classmates and instructors were willing to help at any chance they could
- Overview of some major computer science topics such as big-O, algorithms, and node-trees
- Resume building and useful portfolio projects

Cons:
- Course moves extremely fast through topics
- Your life must be 100% dedicated to the program over the 3 months
- The job search portion could use improvement in terms of providing more networking opportunities through the school such as job fairs.

Overall, choosing to attend a/A was one of the best decisions I could have made to jump right into a career in Software Development. You learn a lot during the program but once completed and even during the program, you must have the self-discipline to go further in your learning. Unless, you have programmed before the course, you will not be 100% ready for a job coming out. You will need to use what you learned and build on-top of it on your own time.

238347,2018.0,True,Hardest days of my life,"Attending the AA was super challenging. I am the type of person that will learn mostly by practicing and going over the material from the lecture. Unfortunately, this was not the case. In AA program you pretty much never look back at the things you have been working on throughout the day and will always try to learn new things each day. With that being said you can already figure out that I was not able to finish the program. I have to say, after being dismissed from the program it really lowered down my self-esteem. At school, I was not a bad student and managed to finish it with 3.5 GPA. I was already experienced with other programming languages and this still did not help me to pass all of the weekly tests. The test overall are super intense and most likely will be harder than the practice ones. But if you try to apply for this course please don't get discouraged by my review, there were some people who felt the same way as I did and they have finished the program... 
I give an average rating of the course because I have never felt like I was getting good enough explanation of my mistakes, and most of those mistakes weren't reviewed since, again - there is no looking back. None of the homework was reviewed either ... simply do it or don't. The TA's are simply students who have already finished the same course, some of them are great and some of them simply cannot pass their knowledge. 
One more thing I would like to mention - the testing system is in my opinion very unfair if comes to programming. There is no code review and if you simply missed that semicolon and you are 1 point below the expectation - you have failed ...",5/3/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.0,[],3.0,3.0,3.0,app-academy
243692,2018.0,True,The best decision of my life,"You've read the reviews. Let me give you a breakdown of what it's actually like:

- You get constant support. You have TAs and students surrounding you. The job curriculum staff are always there.
- When you read that it's an immersive bootcamp, it really is immersive and *intense*. You really can't be doing anything else with your life outside this program. With that said, you get used to it in about 2 weeks and learn to love it. Trust me.
- You really do get a balanced curriculum. You might be worried that other academies focus more on JavaScript, but trust me, you get *more* than enough JavaScript in this program. You also dive into React and Redux, i.e. the future of website building and what will make you really stand out as a developer these days.
- It's a bit drab here. White walls, no art/plants/etc., few windows. Take breaks once in a while to get some fresh air and you'll be fine.
- It's not as impossible as it might seem. Sure, you'll be working 24/7 on this course, but as long as you put in the time and study smart, you will get through it. If you've got a gut feeling that you want do this program, apply.
- Things can sometimes be a bit disorganized. Trust in the curriculum and your instructors, but you also will be relying on each other to get through this course and figure out some of the details that might be overlooked.
- You have a robust portfolio by the end of this. You clone a website, make your own app in JavaScript, and make a larger-scale project on a team. It's a mix of everything and you do really feel like a software developer by the end of this.

236379,2017.0,True,Demanding but Rewarding,"App Academy is definitely a great opportunity to learn a great deal of material in a short amount of time. There's a reason it has a great reputation among bootcamps - the instructors are knowledgeable and helpful, the curriculum is definitely relevant to what is necessary for actual tech positions, and they have alumni placed in dozens of companys and start-ups. All of that being said, here are some questions I would ask yourself before applying:

1. Do you handle pressure well? The courseload itself is very intense (9-6 M-F with homework every night and near-weekly assessments) and the tests are very much point-blank ""can you pound this out in 30-40 minutes or not"". None of this is ever unexpected or unreasonable, but be prepared for a good deal of stress and make sure you have ways to cope with it and stay healthy.

2. How long can you go without having a job? While the course itself only takes 3 months, it is unlikely that you will find a job immediately after graduating. Many students take up to 3 months after AA to find a job, and some take as long as 6. You sign an agreement saying you won't take on any full-time employment during that time, so make sure you are financially stable enough to commit completely to finding an engineering position.

3. Do you actually like coding? If you already know that you're just looking for a quick path to a high-paying job, you'll probably get burnt out very quickly. Obviously you don't have to live and breathe code all the time, but make sure you're doing it at least in part because you find it genuinely interesting.

As long as you've thought through these possible difficulties, App Academy is ultimately a rewarding experience that will leave you impressed with the incredible progress you can make in such little time. It's a lot of work, but in the end it definitely pays off.",4/24/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
243407,2018.0,True,Tough but rewarding,"After graduating college (2 years ago), I decided to pursue software engineering and taught myself through MOOCs, meetups, and attending small introductory workshops for people with a non-traditional tech background. It's safe to say that App Academy was by far the hardest yet most rewarding experience that I've had. I learned more in 3 weeks at aA than what I did in TWO YEARS of teaching myself. 

The thing that I admire most about aA is that they push your limits, they prove to you what your true capabilities are.. and the TAs are there to support you every step of the way. I remember looking weeks ahead during instructional, thinking, ""there's no way I could do that!!"" yet when that week's assignment flew by, I realized how quickly I adapted to the pace of the curriculum and managed to complete what I initially thought was impossible. 

This program isn't for everyone.. but if you know for a fact that this is something that you'd like to do and you're willing to devote yourself 100% for 3 months, then go for it!

Everyday you learn and code new stuff. The process is tough but rewarding. It's a fast-pace learning environment but you get full support from TAs. Most of curriculum is well structured, but some part is still getting improved, so it might cause a bit confusion sometimes.

You will be challenged day-in, day-out, and will frequently need to step out of your comfort zone - especially if you are like me and coming in from a non-CS/technical background. But you will also learn to embrace the structure and come to appreciate the way the curriculum is designed to optimize the amount you learn in such a short timeframe. While you'll mostly never feel entirely comfortable with any topic introduced before you're required to move on, the way everything compounds will eventually help you fill in these gaps and paint the bigger picture. And no matter what you do, you must NOT neglect sleep for any reason - you will not have time to make it up and it will deter your ability to learn and you will quickly dig yourself a hole you'll find hard to climb out of.

App Academy's rigorous and challenging curriculum will probably be nothing like any other educational experiences you've had, and it's certainly not for everyone.

The most valuable lessons I've learned were time management, keeping calm under pressure, and, most of all, learning how to fail. There have been many times when I've been disappointed in myself for not completing a daily project, and even a larger one, but the TAs have been so supportive and encouraging that I've learned to leave regrets behind for greater things ahead.

The TAs they've gotten are extremely helpful and understanding; most of them have gone through the program themselves, so they help you prioritize and manage the workload, as well as give very helpful tips without giving away the answers. Plus they're good people in general too.

One thing to consider: the curriculum is constantly changing and improving, so there will be some inconsistencies and confusion, especially because the NY and SF offices have to share the curriculum. But then again, that's like a real company, isn't it? Don't expect smooth-sailing; expect to be blocked and forced to find solutions to problems you don't expect to happen.

You have no idea what is going on (for a while), but somehow it always works out just fine. Being able to code full-time is amazing on its own, and having a supportive environment is way better than fighting alone. 

Some tips for future students:
- About your peers: Most of my classmates have some coding background or self-studied some languages, while others didn't code before attending aA. There are CS graduates,  and people with non-tech background. It is a diverse group, but one thing is in common: everyone is pretty passionate about coding and wants to make it. 
- About prior experience: Some people have asked me if they can attend without coding experience. In my opinion, having prior experience or not is not the deciding factor. The most important thing is making sure that you really want this. People have different learning styles, so think about whether you like a fast-paced environment.
- That being said, do consider the potential risk of being dismissed after two failures in assessments. We have 6 assessments in total. In our cohort and previous cohort, the dismiss rate is about 20%. 
- If you can, try to learn data structures and algorithms before you start aA. In aA, recursion is taught in one day. It is helpful to know basics such as Big O time complexity, sorting algorithms, etc. before you start this program. Two of the assessments are about algorithms (in Ruby and JavaScript).
- I also hope I had known more CSS before I came in. CSS is relatively easy to learn on one's own, but there are so many details. In aA we don't learn a lot about CSS in the curriculum, just because it is not the focus of the curriculum. Core curriculum includes Ruby, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React/Redux. But you do need to write HTML/CSS in your final projects.
- Pair programming: At first I was skeptical, but it turned out to be the best thing about aA. I learned so much from my coding pairs.

The job search curriculum starts next week. So I don't know yet.

Personal story: I considered switching my career path to coding in 2013. But I thought it's impossible with my liberal arts background. So I didn't give it too much thought and pursued another path. But inevitably I came back to coding. I started to code more in 2016 but still hesitated about whether to apply for developer jobs. When I finally made up my mind it was kind of late. But better late than never... I am grateful for being able to make that decision. No matter the results, had to try. I think you don't have to attend a bootcamp. Just don't give up easily. Try to learn programming for several months and see if you enjoy it. If not, that's fine. Even if you really want to be in the tech industry, there are options: many other roles like marketing/design are fun rewarding jobs too.",4/14/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy

235371,2018.0,True,"Challenging, Rigorous, yet Rewarding Experience","App Academy was probably one of the more challenging academic experience in my life. The pace of the course was no joke. Students were expected to learn and be able to understand that day's material. Be prepared to quickly absorb the materials since the next day will be something completely new. I would advise anyone who is not able to keep up with this pace to reconsider applying to App Academy. However, if you love coding and have aspiration to become a software developer,  App Academy's rigorous course should be your number one bootcamp options as they push you to your limit and allow you grow independently as a developer. 

A roadmap advice for fellow future developers applying to App Academy: one, study up. The bootcamp says they will accept students even if they have not never code before. However,  the coding challenges to get accepted in the bootcamp are not trivial. They will require some basic knowledge of a programming language.  App Academy also offers a free JumpStart program or a Bootcamp Prep course that will prepare you for these coding challenges. If you have never coded before, I highly advise doing either of the programs I mentioned before. They are extremely helpful and you also get a taste of the App Academy's culture before joining. 

Great! You passed the coding challenges and the non-technical interview and are accepted into App Academy. Now what? It is very important to do and complete the Alpha Course before the start of the curriculum.  Ninja advice, the Alpha Course will prep you well for the first two weeks, but you have to keep learning at a fast pace. You will not be doing just Ruby (the first language taught in App Academy) . If you have extra time before starting App Academy, my advice is to read up and look at some code for SQL and Ruby on Rails. This will smooth your transition from simple object oriented programming in the first two weeks to the first real web development process, backend development and database management. 

You are about to make an exciting decision in your life. Prepare for 80 to 90 hours a week of hard work. You will be living and breathing code. You will have no life, but you will form close bonds with your cohort.

Stress: The 9 week curriculum covers a huge amount of content and most of it is challenging. Class is from 9-6, followed by several hours of homework each day. The weekends are mostly devoted to studying for upcoming assessments, which are held roughly every week. So beyond the normal stress that this amount of work induces, there's not really much or any time to take care of yourself by going the gym, hanging out with friends, sleeping, etc.

Time Management: Even though the first 9 weeks of this course are highly structured, you will still need to manage your own time well. This includes giving yourself enough time to sleep, even if your'e not finished with all of the work due the following day. Weeks 7 & 8 comprise a self directed project, and weeks 9 - 12 have very little structure at all. How much you get out of those last 5 weeks, and the amount of time it takes you to get job offers once the program ends all depend on your ability to manage your time well.

Cost: aA now has several payment plans, some of which allow students to defer the bulk of tuition payment until they are employed as software developers. That said, the average job search takes between 3 and 6 months, during which those students are contractually restricted from part-time work. This means you will need to be able to afford food and housing, while not working for at least 6 months (the course + minimum job search). In New York. So even if this program was free, a large cost barrier still exists.

Culture: Even though there's not a lot of time to socialize, the cohorts do tend to get pretty tight, and you will need to to help each other out a lot (emotionally and academically). In my experience, there was a strong culture of collaboration, not competition, which I think is strengthened by the emphasis on pair programming at aA. 

Okay, that stuff out of the way, you will learn more than you thought possible in the course. The instruction is fantastic, both in lecture and one on one settings. The curriculum also teaches you how to approach learning technologies not covered, which will be an essential skill upon graduating. Even though you will likely have to put in a decent amount of work after graduation in order to land a job, you will be well prepared to do so by the course itself. 

If you do decide to attend, you can mitigate a lot of the negative stuff above by preparing well. Attend either JumpStart of Bootcamp Prep. Be really thorough when going through the alpha curriculum prior to the cohort start date. Reach out to people who have gone through the program and ask lots of questions.

Good luck!",4/3/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,,app-academy
234955,2018.0,True,"A solid experience, definitely worth it so far","I have just recently finished the coding portion of the bootcamp curriculum at the NYC campus. I have to say I am definitely surprised at how much I have learned in such a short span of time, but that was definitely not without daily struggle getting through as much of the day's material as possible. The curriculum is definitely grueling. The 70-90 hours of coding a week is a real thing and will leave you without almost anytime for anything else (social life, sometimes laundry, mealprepping). Even after doing 70-90 hours a week, you will have to learn to be okay with some concepts / ideas falling through the cracks as it is inevitable at the learning pace. Throughout the course I felt like I was barely keeping afloat during the material, as most everyone else was, as your TA's will tell you, this is normal. As we progressed through the course, I found myself understanding concepts later on through the week, and slowly found myself struggling with newer material at the tail end of the course. I started to feel not as strong as I did earlier on and worried that I would not be ready to tackle the fullstack project that is completed after the coding curriculum. That was completely not true, once we hit our projects I found out how much I learned and quickly was able to cover the knowledge gaps I did have beforehand just by working through the projects. Overall, I would say that attending this bootcamp can definitely be worth it if you feel as though you can put the time and work in. I would advise any incoming students to put in as much work in as you can as the weeks really do fly by.",4/3/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

243291,2017.0,True,The App Academy rollercoaster,"I’ve thought about this day, the day I would write my review of App Academy, for a very long time. In the weeks before my cohort started I read many of these reviews in search of clues that would help me know what to expect and how to succeed. Wondered if I would ever get the opportunity to write one. Promised myself that I would only contribute to the pile if I made it all the way through the final and ultimate challenge: getting a job.

I start Monday, so here goes.

App Academy is a fucking rollercoaster and during moments of frustration, satisfaction, hope, despair, pride, humility, fun, fatigue, laughter, and crying I often thought: “MY FINGER IS ON THE MEDIUM POST”. Okay, that was only for the bad times. For both the good and the bad the thought was: “this is going in the review”. 

I can’t recall all of what I intended to say during those moments now and a Knausgaard-esque stream-of-consciousness account of my App Academy experience is not what these review sites are for. So I will organize my thoughts into categories and bullet points for maximum skimability.

GENERAL:

- Yes, you do work the crazy hours they say you do. I generally went to bed around midnight and was up at 7 or 8AM. 85-95 hours a week is accurate.
- No, they are not scared of kicking people out. My cohort lost like 20 or 25+%? It can be emotional losing people you befriended. It is depressing seeing people who worked hard have to leave. A lot of it can seem like chance. Anxiety, illness, fatigue, or just having a bad day can make the difference between a pass or a fail. Your best defense against any of these factors bringing you down is simply to study extremely hard for the tests.
- Yes, there is a deposit they don’t tell you about. 
- No, App Academy is not a scam. 

GOOD:

- The TAs. They are all intelligent, articulate, and helpful. You get assigned a TA as an advisor/mentor and mine was above-and-beyond supportive and awesome (shoutout to Anastassia).
- The other students. App Academy attracts a smart bunch of people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Seriously, everyone is so smart. It’s easy to bond with people and make friends when you are all going through the same crazy experience.
- The Ruby and Rails curriculum (first 4 weeks) is excellent.
- For me the full-stack project was the highlight of App Academy. It’s rewarding to see everything you have learned come together to create something real. And it feels great to be able to make your own direction and have some creative freedom.
- You learn React which is hot right now and a big asset when on the job search.
- App Academy was my only option when it came to bootcamps for financial reasons. It sounds corny but it felt like someone believed in me and was willing to put money behind it. This was encouraging and motivating during the hard times.
- Practicing interviewing during the job search helped my anxiety and performance during interviews.

BAD:

- The JavaScript curriculum is a dumpster fire. It's like a hastily-assembled Sunday night book report. Whoever made it seems to have Googled around for definitions of various JavaScript concepts then stitched them together into new documents so App Academy could say it had its OWN JavaScript curriculum. Had to unlearn and relearn lots of JS later on.
- There’s something to be said for all-JS bootcamps like Hack Reactor if you want to be a front-end dev (like me). But I also appreciated learning programming fundamentals in a language like Ruby where I am purely focused on problem-solving.
- The pace and the learning style is not for everyone. I do not learn best through lectures and it takes a little bit of time for new concepts to settle in. So I found myself writing TONS of notes during lectures and asking for one-on-one help from TAs or other students when I needed it.
- Parts of the job search can be very one-size-fits-all. I get why it is this way and that there needs to be accountability but it could be frustrating.
- Algorithms lectures at the end of the course feel like trying to cram 4 years of CS concepts into your brain in two weeks. Lots of room for improvement in the instruction and the structure.
- Constant stress, feeling like the dumbest person on earth because you are around such smart people, beating up your body from long computer hours.
- Tehama.

TIPS:

- DO THE PREP WORK. Do it twice. Study with other people before you start. You want to come into this strong and passing the first few assessments puts you in a far less stressful situation.
- Do the practice assessments a million times. Especially if you are a slower or weaker student like me. Don’t slack on the weekend! If you drill hard all weekend you probably will not fail.
- Sleep. Your brain needs it to work right.
- Ask about deposit assistance if you cannot afford the full $5k deposit. There are some diversity scholarships and other ways you can work it out with them.
- If you get the opportunity to do JumpStart for your admissions process I highly recommend it.",3/23/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
243220,2018.0,True,An intense journey through web development,"App Academy is definitely one of the most difficult programs to get into and stay in. Though I wish that they provided better individual support to its students at times during the core curriculum, they are invested into its students' success. In addition, the pace of the program keeps everyone on their toes - there's always something new to learn, no matter how ahead you may be. I'd recommend a/A to anyone who is confident in staying motivated and working in a lightning-fast environment.

It was definitely a lot of material in a short period of time, however if you put in the time the course is very doable.  I found the TA's to be very helpful and the curriculum to be extremely interesting.  You get to work on a lot of really cool projects during your first 9 weeks, including your own full stack project.

236987,2018.0,True,"Super fast, super fun","I attended App Academy in early 2018. Unlike many of my cohort-mates, I came in without any programming knowledge whatsoever. The curriculum moves incredibly quickly, but if you take it seriously and put in the hours, it's possible. If you're not a really speedy learner, maybe this isn't the program for you OR maybe you'll unlock something in yourself that pushes you towards the finish line. 

The assessment structure becomes very interesting very quickly. My cohort lost historically the most students due to test failures. It's always tough to watch your friends leave. However, studying for the assessments really helped me engrain the basics so I appreciated them a lot.

242997,2018.0,True,App Academy Graduate experience,"I just finished coding curriculum after 9 weeks intensively learning. App Academy has designed a very disciplined curriculum that it pushes each student to learn, to grow and to excel. You can get dismissed if you fail two assessments and one retake. People here are smart and supportive. TAs are incredible. They know what they are teaching and most of them are patient enough to answers questions.

243185,2018.0,True,Tough but not too difficult,"I started AppAcademy cohort on January 15th 2018 and just completed the main curriculum of the course (week 9). I would like to start off by saying that I had some knowledge of computer science. I had taken a course on SQL and basic C++ which indirectly helped me for the first week or two of AppAcademy (they taught Ruby in the beginning so there were common elements between them). However, I would like to stress that although it helped, it does not mean you can slack off. I consider myself pretty much an average student in the class during the whole main curriculum.

I do believe the course is really intense. I also believe if you really put in the effort and really REALLY try to understand what is happening, the course is really not too hard. Assessments are always scary regardless. Two failures is pretty much where most people get dropped out. We lost like 10 out of 56 within the first two weeks. The schedule is basically lecture from 9 to 12 and then do paired programming classwork for remainder of the day. I'll list out a few key points that I learned and thought helped me:

The first key point is to NOT GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to try and complete the daily projects. I know it sounds wrong but it is the a very very important lesson I learned. The instructors will tell you in the beginning that you do not have to complete the projects. Although it feels nice to complete one, the key point of paired programming interaction is to try to understand the material as a pair and mutually benefit. This means if one does not understand it, the one who does should be able to explain it well enough to him/her. This also helps the person explaining reinforce what they learned. You should not feel the urge to complete the projects. They were not made to be completed by most people attending the course but merely as a teaching guide. So really focus on trying to understand material and how it works. Try to do the projects to the best of you and your partner's abilities but do not try to over commit to it. Everyone also learn at different speed. Do not feel ashamed if you do not get to a part in the project that another group got to. You will all learn the same thing in the end. It is a cumulative learning experience.

Another tip I learned was to always get your rest. So this and previous tip I mentioned were my mistakes in the first few weeks. I really tried to complete the work after class and cut down my daily sleep to approximately 5 hours per night on the first two weeks. I felt like I had to get a bit ahead in order to not fall behind. However, the end result was that my performance was worse the next day due to the lack of sleep and I actually get behind on that and the cycle just repeats. Set up a bed time schedule and stick to it. Whatever you are doing for the curriculum (except progress reports) is not urgent enough compared to it. If you did not understand something for the homework, they will explain it in class the day after. After I decided to stuck to my sleep schedule, I never really struggled on my work (except the first solo day, it was really rough though). I also gave up sleep to work on my full stack project. It ended up costing me two days of actual productive work.

I guess the next tip would be to just do the work. It is long and grueling. There are no shortcuts to learning. Just do the work and do your best to understand the homework material. Concepts can be explained by the lecture the following morning or TAs. I can guarantee you that you would not fail if you diligently listen to the these tips. I honestly never read the project ahead or even look at the solutions after the end of the day. For homework videos, you should start using video speed player and get adjusted to the speed. You do not want to watch 3 hours of videos at normal speed. Slow down/pause at parts that you don't understand.

I struggled mostly on week 1 where I really felt like I was underprepared. I did the precourse but there was a large gap until I actually started my cohort. I also was experiencing the struggles listed from the tips above. I struggled on the first solo day and first week of javascript since it was pretty new material coming at you really quickly. I honestly think I broke down maybe once or twice during my fullstack project. I was really sleep deprived and afraid that I won't complete my project (I do not think anyone really fully cloned their project but they did AMAZING work!). Stick to the tips even during fullstack project! I failed to do so.",3/18/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.5,[],5.0,4.0,,app-academy
243174,2018.0,True,"Intense, extremely efficient, extremely fastpaced","I just finished the main portion of AppAcademy's full-time bootcamp in NYC (i.e. week 9 out of the full 12 weeks).  I came into the program with about a year of experience tinkering with Ruby, Javascript, and Python, and some background in logic, and a long history of playing around with computers, but no academic CS background.   My academic background is in the humanities (philosophy and theology) and I spent the first six years after college in grad school, then teaching, then working at a small magazine. 

The course is extremely intense. (I say this as someone who graduated in the top 10% of my class at Yale.) About 25% of my cohort was asked to leave because they couldn't keep up with the pace. That said, the instructors do a good job of helping you through each day, and the structure of the course itself, from one day to the next, is very thoroughly regimented. If you do the course, I recommend surrendering to the routine as much as possible.  There is always more work to do—you will almost never finish a day's projects. The name of the game is to struggle for 14+ hours, get some sleep, and then struggle again the next day. You will work on weekends, you will not have a day off before week ten (and if you think you do, you're probably making a mistake). If you can keep up, you will find that the rate of your learning is really high.

A typical day goes as follows: you arrive at the office by ~8:45am in advance of the morning checkin and go to your assigned seat for the day, with your partner for the day. 9 - 9:30am is spent doing a CSS exercise. 9:30 to about noon is spent in lecture (lectures have built-in Q&A time, and a five minute break in the middle). Lectures cover everything from O(n) and implementing backend Auth to meta-programming in Ruby and state structure design in Redux.  Lectures are generally reinforcement of the essential concepts from the previous night's readings and homework.  This means they tend to be more basic, and more Q&A oriented than the readings—as a result they can feel boring if you understood the readings right away, but the reinforcement is essential.  At 12:30 there's a lunch break, which continues until 1:45pm. Some people work on homework during lunch, but the instructors encourage students to take the time to have a break.  At 1:45 there's another checkin, after which you resume work with your partner, starting the day's projects.  There are usually two or three projects, the first one deals with implementing the concepts in the day's lecture, and then the subsequent projects tend to be more advanced extensions of the same material. You will rarely get through the second project of the day.  Many days you won't even finish the first.  At 6pm an instructor dismisses the class and makes any announcements or reminders.  After 6pm about 1/4 of the cohort will stay behind to complete their homework at the office.  Most people go home to do the homework, which is usually ~3 hours, depending on the number of recorded lecture segments and readings.  After finishing the homework, students are expected to review the solutions to the day's projects, and read through the next day's project instructions in advance.

That's life for the first 7 weeks of the course.  Assessments are usually on Mondays or Wednesdays.  They're terrifying, very difficult to prepare for, and intense, but if you do what the instructors tell you to do to study, and use the provided resources, the test itself should go fine.  In the 8th week the typical lecture/project/homework schedule goes away and students spend about 10 days doing individual full-stake projects.  This building a production-ready clone of a major web application (facebook, airbnb, etc.) from scratch, on your own.  Project presentations happen at the end of week 9, after which the jobsearch curriculum begins.  This is three weeks of lecture, independent projects, application/interview prep, etc. (That's where I'm at right now).  

If I remember, I'll come back and update this review once some time passes so I can assess the program in light of its key promise: to help you get an engineering job. As things stand, it could hardly have been better, except in minor ways here and there (a few unclear assignments, a few weak lectures), but as a learning experience it's up in the top experiences of my life.  Totally practical, radically empowering.  I learned a lot.  And continue to learn about as much in the past two months as I think I could have.",3/17/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
241722,2018.0,True,A Life Journey,"Pros: the learning environment is incredible. I've never seen such dedicated staff that want to help you learn coding and help you get a job. At first, I thought the course was unfairly fast paced, but after a few weeks, I realized just how much knowledge I had accumulated. It also showed me that if I put in the hardwork, it will pay off which had me getting up early and going home late, but all for a worthy cause. I feel accomplished and eager to learn more about coding. 

Cons: I failed one assessment at AppAcademy and I have seen many of my friends fail out. I would only change the assessment fail policy where I would still say three fails in a row and you're out, but if you fail one and you pass the next three, you can clear your fail.

Among all the top students in my own cohort or other cohorts I found none working even a little less than the average. More often they are the hardest working ones.
So if you want to come and prove your worth(as well as change your career and life), do be prepared. It will be a hard journey, but rewarding and amazing.

242908,2017.0,True,My App Academy Experience (Pros and Cons),"I would like to preface this but saying that App Academy has offered all aA graduates an App Academy zip up hoody for writing reviews on multiple sites (switch up, yelp, etc.) and showing their reviews (yes the actual reviews to an aA employee to verify they reviewed it) in order to receive the hoody. Take that for what it is and if students would be capable of providing honest and unbiased feedback.

My experience at aA has its ups and downs. I would say the environment that aA has created is great. Maybe I was fortunate with my class but my classmates were great and the staff I worked with at the time were extremely helpful.

My issues with aA has more to do with how it is run from a systematic level. So I will list a few things to see if aA is the right environment for you, after going through it, personally it was not the right environment for me.

The curriculum is extremely fast paced and loaded with work. If you have no coding foundation, you will easily put 80+ hours a week if you want to keep up. If you don't understand something, you may ask a question, hopefully the TAs or your classmates can help you. If you learn well under stress, then aA will be a good fit. I reached a point where my foundation was not strong with databases and it all fell downhill from there. There was a domino effect of playing catch up while trying to learn the new material. It did not work for me as new material was continually being given but I was already trying to play catch up. That is not how I learn, and I know most students in the program felt the same way as well.

They have recently switched their pricing strategy, so maybe they are working to change the culture but this comment is made with the deferred tuition in mind.

aA is a business first so their goal is to pump out students and for you to get a job. aA doesn't earn money in most cases unless you get placed. With that being said, the job search curriculum is fully driven by you. The expectation is to send around 40 applications a week (they have a strike system to try and keep you to that). The career support is not as developed as I was hoping. Your assigned ""career"" coach would normally just touch bases with you once a week, see what you are up to and maybe give a suggestion. They have very few formalized events (meetups, workshops) for those who are still looking for work to make their candidates more attractive.

During the job search period (period after you finish the 3 month program), you are not allowed to leave SF or NY of within 40 miles without consent as they considered that a violation of your contract. And you are not allowed to work while you are looking for a job. If the job search goes long (you are not allowed to work unless you receive approval), be aware of that coming in.

It should be noted that the job search stats are not voluntarily audited by a third party. I would take the numbers they have listed with a grain of salt on job placement and salary. The bootcamp markets is growing extremely rapidly (more competition for entry level)  and yearly computer science enrollment for undergraduate has increased 3 to 4 folds (again more competition for entry level position) so the salary for entry level is starting to depress (from talks with recent aA graduates).

Knowing what I experienced now, I would not recommend aA to the everyday person. If you are software developer that wants to learn the new technologies in web development, I think it would be a good fit. But if you are the everyday person, I would recommend to look at other boot camps or other alternatives (college) because I don't think the fundamental structure of the curriculum is the best learning environment for most people (high stress, fast, pile on work). 

With that said, I wish you all the best to those who are considering making the switch to software! I was able to get a job, but I felt my biggest strides took place when the stress of the program was taken away personally. If you have questions, feel free to leave a comment, I hope the transparency I have provided has given you another perspective of these alternative education institutions.",3/6/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,2.3,[],2.0,3.0,2.0,app-academy
242820,2017.0,True,"App Academy is Awesome; Job Search, Not So Much","App Academy opened a door to a career in software development that I didn't even know existed (I had thought six-figure software engineering positions only came through traditional paths, such as four-year CS degrees, etc.).

But, after leaving a career in finance, I'm now earning almost double what I was previously (plus I'm in a junior/entry-level role, so that should increase with time/experience), I'm doing something that I love, and I get to work in a relaxed environment (busy, for sure, but it's fun, without any of the stilted corporate rules, like a 50's-era dress code, etc., that I left behind in finance). I have App Academy to thank for this, hence the 5 stars.

So I'm happy to report that it's all pretty much as advertised. It's a rigorous 3 month course that will consume your entire life at the time, but you'll learn a ton, make great friends, and be able to land a fun and lucrative position (eventually) to kickstart your new career in software engineering.

That said, something that wasn't fully emphasized to me upfront is that the job search can become a long, drawn out, exhausting process that I found much harder and less rewarding (at least in the short term) than the 3 months of intense coding. I believe the ""average"" job search time estimated when I first applied was ""3 months"", which was then later verbally estimated at ""4 to 5 months"", and ultimately ended up being 10 months, in my case.

Don't get me wrong; we had one student from our cohort who had a job within 2 weeks of graduating and a healthy number of others had new jobs within the first few months, but many others had job searches much longer than that. Some landed jobs at Google/YouTube, Yelp, Dropbox, etc., while others at smaller startups, and many took on temporary contract work or internships; there's not a single path here, so there's diversity in the success stories and App Academy is pretty flexible in supporting you however you get there.

In other words, I'd keep that in mind and plan accordingly; you might get a job right away, but more likely it will take months, and could very well take almost a year to get an offer, in which case you need to be mentally/financially prepared for that going in. There's a lot of rejection involved when trying to get your foot in the door and all of these companies receive hundreds, if not thousands, of applications. If you're skilled at networking, you'll likely fare much better.

You may have heard how much of a shortage there is for software engineers in the industry right now, but if you check out the job boards (or just attempt the job search), you'll soon find that the shortage is actually for experienced mid-to-senior level engineers, as there is an abundance of junior engineers coming from colleges, self-taught individuals, or one of the many bootcamps, which each churn out about 70 - 80 new junior engineers every three months, with largely the same technical background.

In any case, even though it took me a grueling 10 month job search to finally fulfill the dream, I'd definitely do it again, love what App Academy's given me, and am really excited to grow in my new career.

I can't recommend App Academy enough; just remember that it actually gets harder after the initial 3 month coding program and that you may not feel relieved or at rest until you ultimately accept an offer.

242793,2017.0,True,Difficult but Rewarding,"I'd summarize aA as a rewarding experience, albeit one that was occasionally frustrating.

I came in without any coding experience beyond the Alpha course, which is the curriculum that they require you to complete beforehand. I guess ""require"" is a bit of a strong term - the only hard requirements for aA were attendance and passing assessments, otherwise the only things to keep you doing the homeworks and readings were self-interest. That being said, I'd recommend doing the reading and homework; as far as I'm aware the most successful people in our cohort were those who did all of the work. I got a lot out of them. 

My classmates were great, pretty much all of them were smart and driven.

If it is however, prepare yourself to dedicate your life to programming for 3 months. You will learn a ton. You will get stressed out. But if it really is your passion you will also enjoy a lot of your time at App Academy. Being surrounded by incredibly talented people all working towards the same goal can be an inspiring and productive work environment. App Academy really does seem to care about your success and while some of that is undoubtedly because of the tuition model, a lot of it is just because of the great staff. There are some flaws in the curriculum and the occasional uninspired lecture (the curriculum is always in progress). The chairs, desks and computers are also not great.

242699,2017.0,True,Great! But know what you're getting into.,"While trying to switch careers and knowing that the tech industry is where I wanted to be, I did a lot of research into what the best process was to get started. I didn't have a CS degree, and I knew nothing about coding. After speaking with a couple of tech recruiters in the industry, I was told that App Academy was one of the only bootcamps they take seriously enough to hire straight out of with no previous experience. So speaking as someone who knew nothing coming into App Academy, I feel it's important to stress that they are not kidding when they say it's intense. You will spend on average 100 hours a week trying to learn new technologies at such an intense rate that you'll constantly feel a step behind. I personally loved my experience and am so glad I did it because I learned so many new things, am very proud of what I've accomplished, and truly feel as if I've learned the technologies enough to reproduce results at my next job, but it's not for everyone. I highly recommend it for anyone serious about switching careers and would tell you to not to count yourself out if you don't know a thing about coding coming into it, but keep in mind that if you can't handle 100 hour weeks or giving up your weekends and social life to learn how to code, this bootcamp is not for you. It will become your life for three months, but if you can get through it and want a change in your life that's both financially beneficial and intellectually stimulating, you should definitely apply!

243098,2017.0,True,Life Changer,"I applied to App Academy in December 2016 and attended the May 2017 cohort. I graduated in August 2017, worked at App Academy for a few months, and accepted a job offer in January 2018. Similar to you, I read lots of reviews beforehand and stressed about many details before deciding on taking the risk, moving to San Francisco, and spending 80-100 hours a week at this place.

I read these reviews and my basic impression was that it would be really, really hard. Like a year of college crammed into 3 months. While this is kind of true, I underestimated how much the family and community aspect of App Academy would help. There are weeks where you have to essentially code from morning until night with not much time for anything else. After you learn everything you need to build apps, you learn how to get a job. That entails applying to dozens of postings every week, and it could take months. Throughout this entire process, I felt like a freak, but had 70 friends right alongside doing it with me. They helped me when I was stuck, and more importantly, brought me up when I was down. I don't know if I could've ever pushed myself that hard to get a job on my own, but with my cohort, the process was streamlined and almost (dare I say it) fun.

App Academy teaches a really diverse range of topics so the constant work you're doing is never boring. It's hardly even repetitive, and in fact, you will likely not fully understand most topics until you get to practice them again after the curriculum is over. In the end, App Academy didn't just teach me how to use React and Ruby on Rails. They taught me how to program, how to binge-learn any framework or language, how to speak to others in the field, and how to value myself, find a job, and negotiate as a Software Engineer. It was an absolute life changer in the best way. After going through it, I'm convinced anyone can do it, not just those technically inclined, and have been pushing the idea on all of my old friends who are stuck in a post-college rut with debts to pay.

For me, coding was something I was always eager to get into, but didn't know where to start. App Academy will get you that start and quite a bit further. You WILL build a functioning website by the time the program is over, even if you don't know anything right now. 

Make no mistake, this is stressful. Please be aware that this an environment where, once you fall behind, there is no catching up. If you don't complete something, you have to put it on the ground and you don't come back to it until after the program is done. But also bear in mind pretty much everybody has fallen behind by the end of the course. This is normal. It feels like chaos, but there IS a plan.

The projects could also be improved, as they tended to oscillate between being too vague or too explicit instructions-wise. In my opinion, the daily structure was somewhat tiring with usually a very long lecture in the morning and then an entire day of working with a partner afterwards. It would be more helpful to have the lecture broken up over the day. The instructors are  mostly helpful, but not all of them are very good at explaining programming concepts.

I was once in your shoes looking to see if App Academy was the right bootcamp for me. Well, you're in luck. I'm going to spend the next ten minutes giving you a quick rundown on my thoughts on this program. A quick note of disclosure, I will be  receiving an a/A branded sweater for posting a review but fear not, that review is completely unbiased and independent of that.

As a bit of background, I come from a STEM background (Mech/Aero. Eng) and have been working professionally for about seven years before taking the plunge with very minimal programming experience.  The stories you hear on the program isn't a bluff. It definitely moves at a fast pace to try to shove as much information into you. 

TLDR: You will learn alot in a very short amount of time. This program is really about you getting the most out of it so be prepare to work for it. If this is your dream, if this is your passion, then follow through on it.

App Academy is  tough, make no mistake about it. I never felt entirely comfortable with the  material until a couple of days later and by that time the  course may have moved into something completely new. The dreaded assessments are there to make sure you understand the bare minimum as the material stacks upon itself (and in all honesty, I  feel is why a/A graduates are very strong as you are forced to practice the material repeatedly to truly understand it). The material you cover will be shallow/medium depth, touching surfaces of various technologies and topics but let face it, you will be learning so much including just the ability in how to tackle new problems or to learn new technologies. The lectures and readings are very strong and but the key in all this is the immersive pair programming, tackling difficult programs with your cohort mates although you an buzz in a helpful TA if you get truly stuck. I'm currently at week 8 but I can truly say I feel like a software developer. As long as you can keep up with the material, I think you will be fine. I usually got around 6 hours of sleep a day.

a/A gives you everything you need to become a junior level Software Engineer and it really is up to you to decide how much you can get out of it.

243100,2017.0,True,The most intense three months of your life,"These past few months have been quite a journey.  This bootcamp will push and challenge you in ways you didn't think were possible.  I went from knowing little to nothing about programming to creating a full fledge application in under two months.

App Academy is very selective of their enrollees right from the start during the admission process.  Although the experience differs for each student, it typically involves submitting a coding challenge on a few common problems once you're ready.  If you make through that part, you have to endure a technical interview where you cover a few more problems live over Skype followed by a non-technical interview to assess what makes you a candidate for their program.

If accepted to the program, you go through an at-your-pace online alpha curriculum that covers the basics of programming before you start the bootcamp.  The bootcamp covers three months of education: 8 weeks of the coding curriculum followed by 4 weeks of projects/job search curriculum.  During the 8 weeks of coding curriculum, you will learning everything you need to know about the fullstack process from backend to frontend.  Also, during these 8 weeks, you will be tested on your knowledge of the material every 1 to 1.5 weeks through an assessment.  Failing two assessments will dismiss you from the program.  Even the brightest of students fail an assessment.    The assessments are there to help maintain the quality of students coming out of App Academy as well as provide structure for students.

The structure is something you cannot get out of learning the material on your own.  It forces students to learn the material as well as learn how to learn new material as technology changes in the job market.  Every day, you go through a lecture in the morning starting at 8 AM followed by programming (usually paired) till 6 pm.  Every night you will have readings and homework.  During the day, App Academy has a strike system that ensures you are focused on learning, being present and doing your homework.  This is also another area that can get students dismissed if they accrue enough strikes.  Despite all these challenges, the time you have at App Academy will be among the best in your life.  You will make great friends who will be your network entering the job market.  The staff is also very dedicated to ensuring you succeed in the job market as an eventual software developer.  They're always on hand to help answer any questions you have about the material or the program.  Nearly everyone on staff has also gone through the curriculum and know of its challenges.  They have also seen the program work for many students.  

Make no mistake, this program will push you.  This program is not for everyone.  Everybody comes to App Academy for a reason.  Make sure your reason for attending is strong.

People tend to retain information more when they're stressed out, and the proof of that is show by how much everyone is able to absorb by the end of the 12 weeks.

Before starting the course I had read reviews about that stated how intense the curriculum would be, and now that I am finishing up the curriculum, I can say that it truly is a lot. The course runs you through a bunch of languages and libraries in a short amount of time but does so in a way that works for most people. That being said, you have to make sure that you are ready to work. If you do not put in the time, you will more than likely be released from the curriculum. With that being said, the entire team is there to support you as much as they can. They will sit down and provide needed explanations if you ask them to and, if you are like me, that is incredibly helpful.

I had a fantastic experience here but I must say it is not perfect. The course is 3 months total but they fit the entire learning portion of this into the first 2 months. I wish it was 4 months and we had a little extra time to learn and understand some concepts from a more foundational level, but now that responsibility falls on to the student after graduation. Also, the last month is all about getting ready for the job search and that month has you juggling what feels like a dozen different things at once and is easy to fall behind.

242125,2017.0,True,Good experience,"Before App Academy (a/A) I was in a field that made a fair amount of money but stressed me out and gave me little sleep.  I was a hobbyist programmer that taught myself C++ and Objective-C but I knew that web development was something that I needed to know to succeed as a programmer. So I decided to start reading up on short web development programming schools. I applied and was accepted to each 'boot camp' I applied to--including a/A and Hack Reactor. I picked a/A because I was focused more on how well I perceived their job search support to be. At the time, I felt that I really wouldn't learn too much programming principals but instead learn some frameworks and syntax with whatever boot camp I applied to. Well I was wrong. I learned things like recursion and time complexity at a/A. I don't know how long it would have taken me to even know these things existed if I was learning solely on my own. They are very encouraging throughout the entire process, but especially during the job search. That's not to say they hold your hand throughout the process--you're expected to be a self-starter and ask questions if you're behind. They are more than willing to help, but you've got to ask questions. One thing that I had mixed feelings about was the attrition rate (or amount of people that either got kicked or left the program.) When I signed up the a/A website said attrition was around 5%, now it says it's around 10%. But for my cohort and the cohort before mine it was about 20%. For me, this is a risk that I would not have taken if I knew it was this high. It's 3 months without work and no security that you will be allowed to continue through the program unless you pass all 6 assessments. From my cohort most people that failed out failed either to not putting in the work or being overly stressed about it and either not getting any sleep or overthinking the solutions. Much of passing the tests are memorization. The positive to this is that they are very selective (3% admittance rate like the other top boot camps) but in contrast to the other boot camps this one will continue filtering out students that they feel aren't going to work out in programming where as others will just push them through it. This makes the a/A brand an extremely strong mark on your resume. Overall, I suggest attending this boot camp if you have confidence in your ability to program going into it, but perhaps take a few timed tests or join their Jump Start or boot camp prep program to see if you will cut it if you're unsure.",1/31/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
241938,2018.0,False,The most challenging and rewarding educational experience of my life,"App Academy is everything they say it is-- it is demanding, rigorous, rewarding, all-consuming, high-stress, difficult, very fast, and satisfying.  

It’s stressy.  But the thing about stress is that it can make you grow. This is a data-driven insight, based in real neuroscience-- it's evolutionarily adaptive for people to be imprinted with vivid memories when experiencing raised stress levels. Being confronted with more material than you could possibly work through in the time allotted is both intimidating and inspiring, and App Academy will often introduce new material before old has had a chance to sink in-- this means that you always have a ton going on in the background. Maybe that’s why a majority of the class has literally had dreams about code-- I had one just last night about a non-existent interactive blue screen of death app!  

You end up with little option but to work on code from roughly 9a until 10 or 11p most nights, as well as studying all weekend.  it's literally not possible to keep up otherwise.  If you don't like other people controlling your schedule, this isn’t great.  But nonconformists can do well here.  Myself, I come from a background in nightlife and production, and found it easy to not really go out for three months.  I’ve never been much for structure, I can barely enjoy bowling, what with their ‘lanes’ and ‘scoring systems.’  But having a path hewn ahead of us through the jungle of code education has been extremely helpful in helping me stay focussed and avoid wasting time-- they really do point you directly towards engagement with concepts that will get you producing good work, learning more fundamental concepts, and collaborating well with others.

Like all school, you get out what you put in.  But unlike some other boot camps, if you don't put enough in, you'll be asked to leave-- our cohort shed about ten people who failed the high-pressure, closed-book, timed assessments who either had crippling test anxiety, poor time management, attempted to party or do other work during the cohort, or, more rarely, couldn't absorb the material.  It's up to you whether this is more of a motivation or an inspiring call to fluency under time pressure than something that freaks you out and makes you want to cry.  If you don’t like high-pressure testing, there may well be other boot camps that are a better fit, which would not mean you're dumb.  Some people who've been asked to leave after failing assessments (with a relatively generous prorated refund and kind words) have gone on to be TA's at other boot camps!

241937,2017.0,True,The most structured activity I've ever enjoyed,"App Academy is everything they say it is-- it is demanding, rigorous, rewarding, all-consuming, high-stress, difficult, very fast, and satisfying.  It's a massive commitment, but for many people, the commitment does pay off-- I have friends who have gotten Real Jobs right out of aA with no prior coding experience, within the stated NYC salary range.  The hype is real-- App Academy is debatably the best boot camp in NYC, definitely in the top three.  And as the field gets more crowded with entry-level devs, I think that the outcomes for graduates of less demanding programs are not nearly as positive.  If you're going to do this thing, why not do it all the way?

Like all school, you get out what you put in.  But unlike other boot camps, if you don't put enough in, you'll be asked to leave-- our cohort shed about ten people who either had crippling test anxiety, poor time management, attempted to party or do other work during the cohort, or, more rarely, couldn't absorb the material.  It's up to you whether this is more of a motivation or an inspiring call to fluency under time pressure than something that freaks you out and makes you want to cry.  If you don’t like high-pressure testing, there may well be other boot camps that are a better fit, which would not mean you're dumb.  Some people who've been asked to leave after failing assessments (with a relatively generous prorated refund and kind words) have gone on to be TA's at other boot camps!

The thing about stress is that it can make you grow. This is a data-driven insight, based in real neuroscience-- it's evolutionarily adaptive for people to be imprinted with vivid memories when experiencing raised stress levels. Being confronted with more material than you could possibly work through is both intimidating and inspiring, and App Academy will often introduce new material before old has had a chance to sink in-- this means that you always have a ton going on in the background. The majority of the class has had dreams about code-- I had one just last night about a non-existent interactive blue screen of death app!  You also end up with little option but to work on code from roughly 9a until 10 or 11 (at least) most nights, it's literally not possible to keep up otherwise.  

If you don't like other people controlling your schedule, this isn’t great.  But nonconformists can do well here.  Myself, I come from a background in nightlife and production.  I’ve never been much for structure, I can barely enjoy bowling, what with their ‘lanes’ and ‘scoring systems.’  But having a path hewn ahead of us through the jungle of code education has been extremely helpful in helping me stay focussed and avoid wasting time-- they really do point you directly towards what will get you producing good work, learning more fundamental concepts, and collaborating well with others.

241930,2017.0,True,A great decision.,"I decided to enroll at App Academy to jump start my career change to software engineering. I have a graduate degree in another professional field, and had been working in that field for five years. Given my established career, I had reservations as to whether the course would be challenging enough to warrant the expense and time commitment.

My concerns were quickly alleviated once the course began. App Academy's curriculum is rigorous and challenging. The daily work load is basically endless, and you can learn as much as you have the energy for. After completing the course, I do not believe there is any other way I could have learned so much in the same amount of time.  The curriculum forces you to push yourself, and in the end, you will be a competent developer.",1/23/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
241900,2017.0,True,Best Decision I've Made So Far,"Overall Experience

I personally thought App Academy was incredibly fun precisely because of how challenging it was and it really was challenging. You are surrounded with incredibly bright people, with very interesting backgrounds, and you will push each other to get better everyday. 

Curriculum

The curriculum is easily the strongest part of App Academy. It is truly incredible how much knowledge you will walk away with if you are able to pace yourself and be consistent in doing all of the readings and preparing for the lectures everyday. They offer a lot, but they also require a lot out of you and it is difficult to keep up unless you are able to motivate yourself everyday.

Luckily they provide intrinsic motivation due to pair programming and assessments. Knowing that you have to work with a different person everyday helps you make sure to try to get a good understanding of the subject matter so that you don't slow your partner down. Most importantly knowing that you could be kicked out by failing too many assessments will also motivate you to keep up. This was a main motivator for me attending, because I knew it would always keep me on my toes.

At the end of the main curriculum you will be able to build a fullstack web application that is dynamic, complex, and impressive. That ten day project will be one of the most tiring experiences of your life, but you will be quite proud when you are done. Be sure to celebrate with your cohort mates when it's over.

Diversity

I added this category because I think it's important to note that App Academy is below average when it comes to racial/gender diversity. My cohort was about 5% women and 10-15% non white/asian. This did not affect my experience at all, as someone from an under-represented group, but I cannot speak for everyone and thought it should be noted for others considering App Academy.

Instructors

The instructors are usually App Academy grads. There is a question button during pair programming, which calls over a TA to assist you when you and your partner are stuck. They are all very cool, helpful, and the lectures are incredibly informative. The lectures will usually go over the reading and assignments for the night before and introduce some new material for the day ahead, so make sure you come prepared. 

Job Assistance

The Job Search Curriculum in the last three weeks can feel a bit anticlimactic. You've just spent 9 weeks going 100mph and then all of the sudden things slow down quite a bit. It can be a good thing because everyone is a bit burnt out from the fullstack project, but I wish there was a way to keep a similar pace going. Here you will work on your portfolio, build a nice online presence, learn how to approach networking, applying, negotiating etc. 

Don't come in thinking App Academy is going to provide you with all kinds of contacts and connections. I don't think they have any more ability to get you a job than any other bootcamp. However, they have a great reputation with companies in NYC and SF and a huge alumni network in those respective cities. I attended App Academy in NYC and I can tell you there are companies that only hire App Academy grads because the curriculum is more in depth and the projects are more impressive. 

Outcome

Personally, I applied to 305 jobs, had 6 phone screens, 3 on-sites, 2 offers, and landed an awesome job at a startup in NYC 3 months after graduating and I couldn't be happier. 

The job search is an absolute grind, but don't get discouraged. Just stick with it, apply everywhere, and don't say no to yourself! You never know who will get a job, even if everyone applies to the same one. There is a lot of luck involved and each person is unique even though you all graduated from the same course.

Be financially responsible, make sure you have enough of a safety net so that you can focus, and it'll all come together in the end.",1/22/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
241733,2017.0,True,"Difficult, But Worth It","App Academy was definitely the hardest 3 months of my life. At times it was a bit brutal, with 10% of our cohort getting kicked out before the end of the program. The program is certainly not for everyone, but if you are a fast learner AND can dedicate pretty much your entire life to the program, you can get a job as a Software Engineer after this program. You certainly are expected to work as much as you everyday. Everyone is incredibly smart and motivated; I went to a top school in the United States, but found my peers here to be heads and tails above my university peers.

That being said, they do deliberately pace the course so that you can keep up -- pushing you to the brink and then giving you a few days for the material to sink in. I was also able to take a small handful of days off, but some are unable to do so. 

I had absolutely NO computer science background before attending, and ended up getting a job within the first month following the program, so this program DEFINITELY fulfills its promises.",1/16/2018,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

241650,2017.0,True,Fantastic experience and education,"The pros:

Working with a group of motivated individuals is infectious and has you working as hard as you can to learn and understand the curriculum.

The sheer density of how much you learn and run through is incredible given the time constraint.

Instructors are kind and knowledgeable of every topic. They are also understanding that some students (myself included) have little to no experience.

Cons:

The pace at which the course moves can be overwhelming. Be ready to learn or you will be left behind. I recommend the bootcamp prep. It would have been nice to have a couple more weeks to fully understand certain topics.

241639,2017.0,True,An intensive (but rewarding) experience,"I am a student 9 weeks into the full-stack curriculum at the New York location.  If I remember, I will go back and edit this after going through the job search.  I have greatly enjoyed my time at App Academy so far.  Looking back, it is astounding how much ground we have covered in that time.  Myself and all my classmates have just finished our full stack web applications—and it amazes me how far we were able to take them.  I remember sitting in the classroom on the first day, apprehensive and excited to start learning… since then it has been a whirlwind of learning and doing.  You will look back and marvel at how far you have come in so little time.  

That being said, this program is hard work.  You will need to steel yourself for long nights and stressful exams and projects.  Some, of course, will have an easier time than others depending on your background and how well you’ve prepared for the bootcamp.   But at one point or another, everyone who gets through puts in a lot of time and effort to do so.

I have often been running on 5-7 hours of sleep—less on particularly intensive nights.  I estimate I’ve put in roughly 80-90 working hours a week (more if you include my commute each day).   If you want to keep up and get all the readings/activities done, expect to be spending many hours learning and coding.  Fortunately, if you’re anything like me and most of my cohort-mates, then you’ll enjoy learning software development. 

By this point you’ve probably read a lot of reviews telling you App Academy is hard for many people.  This is true.  Some do not make it to the end.  About 15 people from our class failed two assessments and a retake and were asked to leave as a result.  

However, I am a firm believer that if you’ve gotten through the applications process at App Academy, you have what it takes to make it to the end.  If you end up going to App Academy, please believe in yourself, and work your ass off.  A good number of my classmates failed the first assessment (by far the easiest one), bunkered down, and killed the rest.  Do not be discouraged if you stumble.  

I’d like to close my review with some advice for prospective students.  I have done fairly well with the program thus far and think it is prudent of my to share some of my preparation and study strategies that got me to where I am.

1.	If you’re looking for introductory materials, I definitely recommend the MIT eDX course, ‘Introduction to Programming in Python’
2.	Do as much preparation as possible.  Of particular help to me was training fundamentals in Ruby on codewars.  Aside from that, do what interests you from the options below:
a.	Learn HTML5 and CSS3 at least to a basic level.  In particular, learn the basic input types for html and how to use flex in CSS (look up flexbox froggy).  If you can, try and recreate static versions of popular webpages from pure html and css.
b.	Learn SQL.  We did this is about half a week, but it was pretty rough for some.  If you’re dedicated, you can do the same and not have to stress about it during the course.
c.	Learn about the Model, View, Controller design pattern and its advantages/tradeoffs.  Research ruby/rails or some other framework and see if you can learn the basics of app development.  I would not recommend doing this before having a solid grounding in all the fundamentals though.
d.	For the mathematically inclined with time before the course begins, go follow along with an algorithms course online.  Learn big-O notation and algorithmic analysis.  I personally followed along with the free MIT OCW lectures and assignments for 6.042J with Tom Leighton and 6.006 with Srini Devadas.  If you already feel comfortable with basic programming and want to be ahead of the game for the job search, this is a good option for you.  
e.	If you really want to go the extra mile like me, go ahead and read a design patterns book (I used Head First Design Patterns, but Gang of Four is the canonical work to reference)
3.	During the course, hit the ground running and do all the readings you can.  Definitely drop all other responsibilities (or as many as possible).  You don’t want to be dealing with anything else while tackling the curriculum.  If you have a decent commute, it will be fairly impossible to do anything else.  Speaking of the commute, preload the readings and download the videos they give you so you can watch them offline on your way there/back.  If you can, study in the office around others where you can ask your classmates questions.  If the homework is taking you too long, just send it up and put it away—you will be going over the material in greater detail tomorrow.  
4.	Lastly, and most importantly:  Make friends!  You have the opportunity to study alongside many with similar motivations and career goals.  Your classmates will be among your greatest resources during the course and moving forward.  The people who are thriving in my cohort are largely those who made an effort to be social work with their classmates.  Coming in to week 9, I can count a number of my them as good friends who I can expect to keep in contact with for years to come.  For that reason alone, it was worth it to me to attend App Academy, and they’ve made my time here feel so nice.

241047,2017.0,True,Intense but Rewarding,"App Academy (NYC) was the best investment I've ever made. If you're willing to put in the time, you will come out having learned more than you thought possible. Make no mistake, it is a big time commitment. You should be fully prepared to spend a month doing prep work, then 9 weeks of 80+ hours per week. However, the staff on hand is amazing. All of the TAs are extremely helpful and responsive. There is always someone around to answer your questions. For me, the best part is coming out having actually made some really cool projects. The structure really helps reinforce topics: you watch videos and do readings as well as a short hw at night, then have a lecture on that material the next day and spend the rest of the day working through problems. Another great aspect of App Academy is the curriculum. You touch on everything you have to learn to be successful, and by the time your done it will be easy to adapt to new tools and technologies.",1/11/2018,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
241462,2017.0,True,"Worth it, for the dedicated","App Academy is just as difficult as they claim. You really will need to spend upward of 85 hours a week on your studies if you want to be successful, but if you have the time and the discipline then don't be scared away. I've had very, very little free-time over the past months, but in exchange I've gained an extremely valuable skill in less time than I could have imagined before beginning the program.

The instructors are top-notch. Everything in general is conducted extremely professionally, from the location and the building/amenities (I attended the NY branch), to the assessments and the projects. Before joining the program I was under the impression that I could have learned all of the same skills on my own, using free resources online. Looking back now, this miiiiight be possible, but it honestly would have taken me more than 10 times as long to do alone. Having the instructors on call, and the other students as pair-programmers was indispensable for me. Again, the program is totally worth it for those who are serious about becoming full-stack developers. But again, there is no hand-holding.

It's a huge commitment, so be prepared to spend basically every waking moment thinking about code. You'll be dreaming about it too.

The course does a great job of making programming accessible to everyone, no matter your background. The staff are extremely supportive and accessible, so there's always help when you need it. You also end up having a wonderful support system from your peers, since you end up spending most of your time with them and you all share the same struggles.

I would definitely recommend App Academy to anyone who's willing to devote all of their time to code. If you fall behind at all it's really difficult to catch up, so make sure you're ready to dedicate all of your next three months to the program.",1/8/2018,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
241455,2017.0,True,Really Intense but Rewarding Experience,"As many of the reviews state below, it is a very intense program, but it is indeed rewarding. I'll discuss some reservations I had about App Academy, and some tips for future applicants/attendees. 

I come from a liberal arts background, and have never taken a computer science course before I started Jumpstart (a great way to get ready for App Academy's admissions process if you are offered a spot in the program). To be honest, I had reservations about the price tag of App Academy and whether it would be worth it ($22k+ is a lot of money).But as the course progressed, those reservations disappeared as I really realized that there was absolutely no way that I could have learned the amount of material on my own in such a short period of time.  Prior to App Academy, I had a pretty decent job with great benefits at a private university, and part of the reason why I decided to leave that job was because of the amount of waste that I saw funded by student debt and high tuition prices. In contrast, App Academy's model of deferred tuition is still pretty revolutionary even if you have to pay a $5k deposit. I think part of what makes it work is that the student to instructor ratio is pretty low (I think it's around 1 to 8 or maybe 1 to 7 as we did loose 12 members of our cohort who did not pass the assessments). Again, that sort of student to instructor ratio is not something that is possible in most higher ed settings. 

There are 6 assessments throughout the course, and if you fail 2 (you are offered one opportunity for a retake after the second assessment), you are asked to leave the course. This causes a super stressful environment where many of the students are scared of failing out. The assessments do force you to internalize the material in a way that you probably wouldn't if you didn't have the assessments. In my opinion, the assessments are a flawed tool for measuring student progress, especially because it causes a lot of students to focus on just what would/could be on the test, but it is App Academy's way of measuring that you have the minimum amount of knowledge to continue progressing in the course (as I do think a few cohort mates who were asked to leave could have done well and finished if they had been allowed to stay). 

Aside from 1.5 to 2 hours of lecture, most of your day is spent pair programming with the same person for the whole day (for some projects, two days). Pair programming really does help you solidify your understanding, as you have to verbally communicate your thoughts to another person and vice versa, and forces you to stay on track the whole day. Except for maybe 2 instances, I found pair programming to be a very enjoyable experience. 

I will say that even if you've never taken a computer science course, and even if you struggle to keep up throughout most of the course, if you are comfortable with pushing your boundaries and keep up with the course material, you can succeed. Prior to starting the actual course, App Academy gives you materials (Alpha course) to study on your own. Make sure you do all of it (twice, if possible!) and give yourself time to do it. This will set you up for success. They recommend 4 weeks for this prep work, but especially if you plan on working right up till you start the course, I would say you need more like 6 to 8 weeks. The last thing I wanted to say was aside from the mental exertion and total time commitment for 12 weeks, I found the course to be physically grueling, and felt absolutely exhausted the first two weeks of the course.

The JavaScript and  Flex projects are crucial to our portfolios but we only get a week to do it while having to attend multiple lectures throughout the day but I suppose that's why it's called a boot camp. The TA's for the first part of the course were amazing and are the highlight of App Academy--the job search TAs are amazing as well but they seem slightly understaffed.",12/16/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
240872,2017.0,True,One of the best decisions I've made...,"Attending App Academy has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've had thus far, and I have not even started job hunting yet. If you attend, be prepared to drop pretty much everything else from your life for the duration of the program. Also be prepared that if you don't truly love programming, you may get burnt out during that time.

I'm truly amazed at how much I have learned in such a short period of time, and how hard I've been able to work to achieve that goal. As cheesy as it sounds, now that I've made it through the program, I feel as if any goals I have are achievable if I can muster this kind of work ethic.

There are certainly things about this program that could be improved. However i do like that as the course went on, and especially now in the job search curriculum, you become more and more independent as you learn how to teach yourself. Some people may feel they want more hands-on instruction, but I thought they provided a good balance.

240664,2017.0,True,Overall great experience,"Pros
This is by far the longest and hardest I've worked my entire life. Yes, I'm putting in 90+ hours every week but I'm honestly enjoying the entire process thus far. There is a massive sense of accomplishment taking projects from concept to completion in one to two weeks. You'll meet and bond with amazing people and have TAs stay late to help you with your projects. From my experiences so far, I would definitely take this route again.

Cons
The TAs are students that had just graduated and immediately begin teaching the next cohort. Some of the curriculum seems disorganized or is material take from other sources and repurposed for a/A. I don't feel like I'm ready to begin the job search and meet a/A's bold salary claims.

242961,2017.0,True,"Their Main Curriculum is Great, but the Rest Sucks","I have mixed opinions about App Academy. 

There are 3 main sections to App Academy's overall curriculum. Once you're accepted into App Academy, there's Alpha Course (a 1 month long online preparation),  the Main Curriculum (~10 weeks of onsite learning), and Job Search Curriculum (~4 weeks of onsite learning geared toward getting a job).

Alpha Course is awful. It's disorganized and poorly structured. They are working on improving it, but it's obviously a work in progress.

The Main Curriculum is fantastic. It's engaging and you'll genuinely learn a lot from your experience. The TAs are the highlight, willing to stay behind late and help students with their projects/lessons/homework. It's tough, but very engaging and satisfying. Some of the video assignments are poor, but the vast majority of the Main Curriculum is good.

In contrast, Job Search Curriculum is poorly designed and unorganized. Important information and references are split among multiple different locations and require students to go on a scavenger hunt to find the simplest of information. The schedule is poorly set to encourage haphazard results and indifference to crucial portions of the curriculum. The App Academy website for the Job Search Curriculum is an absolute joke in comparison to the Main Curriculum. The difference in quality is laughable. Feedback for projects and assignments is slow and disjointed. The kindest adjective to describe feedback for our assignments would be unreliable- in quality and in quantity. The staff do seem to try sometimes and I'm sure they're nice people, but they're understaffed.

240873,2017.0,True,Don't underestimate how hard this will be.,"I was extremely attracted to this program because I believed that the payment structure would keep the instructors and the company accountable, as well as push me outside of my comfort zone and challenge me; I just didn't know how much it would challenge me. It was hard in every way; mentally, physically, socially. Hours of pair programming everyday can really break a person down especially if they are an introvert, and the speed at which we covered the material really makes you reevaluate your intelligence. I never felt this much pressure until I came to this program and honestly, I got extremely burnt out around week 6. It took awhile to recover from that; it involved a lot of learning how to take care of myself. That being said, the payoff has been enormous. I have had preconceived ideas about other people challenged and disproven, I learned more in the past 11 weeks than I have in years of schooling, I've met amazing people and made what will probably life-long friends (suffering really does bring people together), and while my confidence in my intelligence is at an all time low, I know that this is the most substantial thing I've accomplished up until this point in my life so I am also proud of myself. Imposter syndrome runs rampant, especially when you see people that you considered to be capable developers cut from the ranks (a good amount of students get cut from the weekly assessments),  and it's normal to get up to week 8 and feel like you don't know anything at all, only to hit your fullstack project and pretty much learn everything out of necessity. Take away is this: know how to take care of yourself, know what you need to do to get by in a stressful environment, and be honest with the limit of your abilities. When your abilities seem to fall short of what is needed and you fail an assessment or screw up a project, learn to forgive yourself and pick yourself up and move on, there's no time to wallow, and there's no time to be so hard on yourself, the program is hard enough as it is.

You sometimes have to really go out of your way to get any help or clarification on anything. I had a pretty awful experience during the first project phase, partially because of this. It's pretty easy to get a sense of imposter syndrome, and with no clear way to turn, that can be tough. All in all though, they really care about your success, and they demand a lot.

240424,2017.0,True,Rewarding experience!,"I recently completed the 12-week software engineering track at App Academy’s San Francisco campus. Before attending App Academy I had some experience in coding but I have never studied computer science or attended any coding course.

What I think is great about App Academy:
1.	The course is very well structured. Course materials increase in complexity and difficulty as the course progresses and by the end of the course, a student should have a very good understanding of both the frontend and backend mechanics of a web application, all in a matter of 12 weeks.
2.	Each day I work with a different member of the same cohort to resolve some coding challenges. I enjoy working as a team and I also have the opportunity to learn how to work with and adapt to people with vastly different working styles. 
3.	There are weekly assessments which I think is a good way to test what I have learned in the preceding week.
4.	The campus is located in downtown San Francisco which is very convenient.

Other things that you should know about App Academy:
The course is intensive and the learning curve is steep for most students (unless you have a very solid background in coding, but even for some members of my cohort who had fairly solid prior experience in coding they still found it challenging). Completion devotion to the program is expected from every student.

On the whole I am very satisfied with my experience at App Academy although I would hope the program to be a bit longer (say a few weeks more) and to add a reading week in the middle of the course so that students can review or study an area in particular.",12/7/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

Having dedicated support from people who thoroughly understand the curriculum saves on learning time immensely and allows you to learn more over the course of the day.  Given that the course implements a deferred payment system, there are weekly tests that gauge your standing in the course and if you are not up to par, you will be asked to leave.

Everyone is generous, caring, and will bend over backwards to help you succeed.  They will also kick your butt every step of the way as well.  App Academy students are immensely talented and capable, not to mention driven and focused.  I am by far one of the slower and older of the cohort, and every single day I am humbled and amazed by what my peers and the Teaching Assistants can do.  

Unless you have supreme confidence in your ability to learn and apply new information extremely quickly, do yourself a favor an prepare - especially if you do not come from a STEM or CS background and double-especially if you are older and have been out of school for a while.  No words can do justice for the manner in which the curriculum simply avalanches once you begin to fall behind.  So prepare, prepare, prepare.  Take nothing for granted and try to research on your own each and every the bullet point listed on the curriculum section of the main site.   Coming in with even a little familiarity with the content will enhance your experience 10 fold.  When you are current/ahead with the material, the days move by quickly, the pairings are a blast, the assessment material will have time to soak in, and most importantly - you earn everyone's respect. 

All in all, a/A is great and I would do it again. It's hard to get in, and even harder to be an a/A student. You will get wrecked.  Repeatedly.

Once accepted, you'll spend a month mastering the prep work to get up to where you need to be for day 1 - THIS IS IMPORTANT!! If you do not have complete mastery of the prep material, you will fall behind!

Reading reviews and talking to graduates, they'll all tell you to be prepared to spend 100+ hours reading, writing, breathing code - impossible right? The truth is, you'll spend every waking hour dedicated to coding - you'll wish you had more time to prepare for an assessment or to finish a feature on a project. The curriculum is definitely challenging and will bring you to your breaking points - all of this is to push you further and to ensure you know what you're doing.

240884,2017.0,True,Brutal but worth it.,"Coming in to this boot camp, I had read over 80 reviews and thought I had a pretty good idea of what the program would be like. I made sure I had a good knowledge of the prep material and a good idea of how my time would be spent every day of the week. I expected to spend 80-90 hours a week in front of my computer screen, either coding or studying. After going through the first 10 weeks of the program, I can say that having those expectations beforehand helped tremendously in giving me the right mindset to succeed at a/A. Don’t get me wrong, there were plenty of days where I felt behind in learning the material, or felt like I wasn’t good enough to be there. But that is somewhat expected when you’re knee deep in an intensive learning environment such as a/A’s. 

Weekends are key. If you are feeling behind or struggling with the material, utilize the extra time that you will have on the weekends to catch up on material that you don't fully understand or to get ahead on the next weeks material. You definitely get what you put into to the program, and since you are all doing this program with the end goal being a rewarding software development job, you'll want to put in everything you have. 

That being said, don't become a hermit who just sits in front of their computer screen from morning till night. Go to the gym for an hour or get outside for a walk here and there.

240197,2017.0,True,AS ADVERTISED (except the 5% dropout rate),"6 months ago, I was at my first full-time job (technical consulting) coming out of undergrad. In undergrad, I did not study anything tech-/coding-related. The job had very nice people but I found the work (or lack of it) underwhelming. Having dipped my toes into the tech industry with this company, and having some familiarity with coding through Codecademy, I explored online how I could gain the skills I needed to have a career in tech.

At first, I did an online graduate course through a university. The curriculum had holes (and it would have taken 2 years to get the degree). Based on that experience, I decided to look into coding bootcamps. I found out about App Academy through SwitchUp, which appeared as the top result of my google search.

Looking through the different programs listed, not all of them had full-stack curricula. When I applied to some of them, all they had was a Skype interview and maybe some online prep material. App Academy stood out in that it had practice problems to solve, then an online coding challenge, then a technical interview, then an interview for cultural fit. It had by far the most fleshed-out, formal process from my experience.

In addition, the deferred tuition model is appealing. But bear in mind the corresponding risks. If you have been a strong student academically or have prior experience coding, you will very likely make it through App Academy's curriculum. However, as App Academy scales, the 5% dropout rate of old is inaccurate--it's more like 20-25% in recent cohorts. The upside is that if things don't work out, you don't pay 100% of the cost.  The downside is if you really want to get into software development, getting kicked out would really hamper that.

How App Academy frames it is whether or not things work out for you, i.e. you are able to learn what they teach. Let me say: the curriculum is superb, the environment is supportive, and you are able to fail 2 of the 6 unit assessments and still make it through if you pass the retake of the second test.

So as you compare your options, consider whether you are willing to pay $17,000 upfront to another top-rated full-stack program that won't kick you out, or if you believe you will respond well to App Academy's incentives and view the coding bootcamp more as a way to discover whether or not you want to be a software developer.

All that said, if you make it through, you will build a clone of a major tech site. You will understand how the frontend, the backend, the database, middleware, and everything else functions. You will have a culture which facilitates a transition into tech extremely well (as you'll be pair-programming much of the day, every day).

The last thing I'll note is that cultural fit is important. Please make sure App Academy seems like the right fit for you.",12/3/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],,5.0,,app-academy
240190,2017.0,True,An Amazing Experience...Just Be Prepared,"Having just finished App Academy's main curriculum, I can say with confidence that this program is not for everyone. Although I was extremely engaged by the material, had a great time working with the TAs, and have met some great people in my cohort, it's clear that coding bootcamps, especially App Academy, demand a work ethic that not everyone is prepared for.

Be prepared to spend 12-14 hrs a day working on code (commuting time included). Be prepared to undergo serious pressure as failing assessments can lead to direct expulsion from the program. Be prepared to embrace the fact that there will be some concepts that will stump you into submission. Be prepared to sacrifice your life as you know it to succeed in this program.

Would I do it again? Definitely.

I came from a minimal coding background and my skills increased exponentially. I loved the curriculum and being in a pure learning environment--I thought of it like supercharged undergrad (having been on the quarter-system I was used to a faster pace). 

Why I'm giving 4 stars: there is little to no diversity at all. I could count on two hand ALL students in my cohort who are queer, female, and/or of non-caucasian or non-Asian descent.Having grown up in the East Bay, I was shocked and discouraged by the lack of diversity in the classroom. It also became evident that most students came from educated, middle-class backgrounds and didn't have anything to lose by quitting their jobs to enroll in a coding bootcamp. 

Coding bootcamps are a business, period. But I personally believe that because they advertise themselves as a sort of trade-school-esque-alternative to college, they should make an effort to market themselves to the communities that statistically enroll less in 4-year colleges: individuals from working-class backgrounds and select minority communities. 

Bottom-line: the curriculum is fantastic, the people are great. just be prepared for a lot of work and a relatively sterile and uniform social environment for 3+ months.",12/2/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
240178,2017.0,True,"Fast-Paced, Fun,","Overall:
The curriculum is so fast paced. Get ready to work 90+ hours. The projects were fun (sample projects: twitter clone, tic-tac-toe, pokedex). The people were great. I can't believed I've learned so many things in 3 months. I've considered other top boot camps but App Academy was the best fit. 

Assessments:
There are 6 assessments. First fail is free. If you fail a second assessment, you have a chance to retake. If you pass the retake, great! However you can't fail another assessment or you'll be dismissed. If you don't pass the retake, you are immediately dismissed.
My cohort lost ~20% of the students from failed assessments. 
However, all of the material tested on the assessments are KEY concepts that you will need on your full stack project.
I don't recommend App Academy if you have severe test anxiety.

Projects:
1) Fullstack Project (Ruby on Rails Backend, Javascript React Front End): 10 days
2) Javascript: 4 days
3) Flex Project (3~4 member group project, incorporating new technology/api that wasn't used in class): ~10 days

Curriculum:
- The key topics are intentionally repeated throughout the course to ensure that you'll remember these after course. For example, you'll learn back-end user authentication for Rails week 4. You'll study back-end user auth for one of the assessments. Then you'll learning front-end user authentication week 7. In week 8, you'll combine back-end and front-end for in class projects AND your full stack project.
- There is are HUGE emphasis on having readable code (having good syntax + variable names so other people can understand your code), DRY code , and the importance of modularity. These are all key concepts to any software developer.
- App Academy has a job search curriculum other top bootcamps do not have. You go over frequently interviewed topics.
- Learning so many things in 3 months though is mentally tiring. However, don't give up. Just keep learning. Once a week, I'll question if App Academy made a mistake in accepting me. I'll hit a huge conceptual roadblock and feel inferior to my peers.  However, no pain, no gain. Usually the day after, I'll have more time to reflect on what I just learned and be able to use those skills right away in the current project.

Culture:
- The culture is so welcoming and inviting.
- I felt other bootcamps I was interested had a more top-down culture. App Academy is more collaborative. 
- The emphasis is to learn and grow, not just plow through the material as fast as possible.
- You can tell the staff loves what they do. There are cute animal references and memes all throughout the curriculum/lectures.


Pro-Tip: 
- Use your weekends to the fullest. Take time to look into next week's curriculum as well as solidify your knowledge from the past week.
- Learn the basics on Javascript ES5 and ES6 before the curriculum starts.
- Make sure you put your best effort in learning the pre-course material. You'll have an easier Week 1 if you do.
- Try your best not to fall behind. Once you do, it's going to feel like a never ending battle balancing old material you didn't really know AND new material being thrown at you.",12/2/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

My main complaint with the program  is that you are treated like a child, which might be helpful for some but I found irritating.  You are required to submit daily reports on your progress with questions like ""what did you learn today"", which are never responded to unless you appear to be struggling (i.e. failing an assessment).

They want you to think you can do it since you have to be confident to succeed but the bottom line is that people will fail out of your cohort and it isn't always because they didn't try hard enough.

239366,2017.0,True,My Time at a/A,"My experience at App Academy definitely lived up to the intensity that others had described. Be warned, it really is intense. It’s physically and mentally draining. If you have any kind of background related to computer programming you may have a better time. As someone without a background I had to work constantly just to hang in there. Nearly everyday I was confused by what I was learning and that was definitely something hard to get used to. I’d never felt so impotent in my life. I averaged 5-6 hours of sleep at night and was slowly enveloped by a thick fog. The longer I went without sleep the more confusing and difficult things became. It got to the point I could barely remember the conversations I’d just had with people. Luckily I was always able to catch up on some sleep during the weekend and get back to ‘reality’ for a couple of days. If you are planning to take the course you should know that if you want to succeed the course will have to be your life. This is difficult to maintain, but it is possible.
	In hindsight I believe I may have taken somewhat of the wrong approach to the course (although I don’t regret the way I accomplished it). I did everything they told us to do. I did all the readings and all the homeworks every night. This is the reason for my lack of sleep. I tried to do everything, and many of my fellow classmates did not. I think I allowed myself to get so tired that the work I was doing wasn’t helping as much as it was hurting me. 
	If you’re looking just to pass the course, I believe it may be pretty easy. All the exams were very very closely related to the given practice exams. If you know how to memorize a practice exam and other topics that may appear on the exam, the exams are easy. You should be able to take the practice exam in half the expected time. If you can do that, I believe you will pass the real exam. There weren’t really any curveballs. 
	That said we did lose many classmates from the exams. A student was even sent home on the last exam. I believe we lost a total of 12 people, and started with 62. I believe that those students probably had tried to do too much and weren’t able to effectively learn the practice exams. 
	It’s a tough course and it’s important to make good friends throughout the program. Don’t count on being comforted by the staff. It’s required to fill out progress reports every night, but then you are given the impression that no one ever reads them. It’s like shouting into the wind. I was never once approached to discuss my ideas or encouraged to keep up the good work. 
	But the community is great and you feel an unspoken bond with everyone in the course. We’re all suffering together. 
	You will learn the curriculum that they advertise and you will become a fullstack developer. 
	I am about to start the job search curriculum of the program and hope that I will be able to find a job. I do feel that I have learned a lot since I started and look forward to continuing my education. 
	The rating is hard for me to give because I am yet to know how effective I will be at securing a job.",11/6/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],3.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

In that time I used free resources such as Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, and CS50 EDX. After joining App Academy, I can confidently say that I learned exponentially more in app academy than I did in the two years that I spent with those free resources. App academy provides a curriculum that keeps you engaged and challenges you to reach past what you thought you were capable of and bring more to the table than ever before.

239359,2017.0,True,App Academy - challenging but worth it,"Pros: Good TAs and fast paced curriculum. It's pretty unbelievable how much you'll learn in 9 weeks. If you're a self-starter and enjoy the fast-paced learning, you will get a lot out of the program. 

Con: Unforgiving pace and schedule. It's easy to fall behind if you don't put in the time/work. The learning style might not be suited for everyone. The near weekly assessments can be stressful  (around ~15% of each cohort ends up getting asked to leave for failing assessments). 

General tips: Do the prepwork! You're not starting with the assumption that you don't know anything day1. You're expected to be able to do small object-oriented programs from the very beginning, and you definitely don't want to start off behind.

239358,2017.0,True,"An excellent bootcamp experience, but stressful","DISCLAIMER: I will be getting a hoodie from App Academy for writing this review, but the content of the review will not be influenced by this ‘reward’

I came to App Academy with a limited background in Computer Sciences and STEM fields and, 9 weeks into the program, have come out with a complete entry-level knowledge of full-stack development. The resources that have helped me from getting from point A to B in such a short amount of time was the rigor and depth of a/A’s curriculum. The most important reason is that the curriculum is so effective is that class-time enforces students to be immersed in programming and coding challenges for a maximum amount of time. The pair-programming aspect of the curriculum is a strong way to enforce communication skills and forces students to have a deeper understanding of new lessons when they are encouraged to explain their thought-process to their peers. The quality of said peers is also generally excellent in terms of character and ability. While pairing chemistry will never be perfect between every student, it was always evident to me that my peers took their time in the program very seriously and were always concerned with learning the material deeply, preparing for each class adequately, and producing high-quality work. The teaching staff is also generally excellent. I found that the quality of individual instructors would often correlate to their time in the program, but because the curriculum is so intense, the more junior instructors themselves also appear to improve quite rapidly. While there was sometimes a quality gap between new and veteran instructors, the actual time-difference between the former and the latter was usually only a cohort or two. And generally, I found that the entire package of TAs, who do all of the teaching at App Academy, was excellent and foundational to my own learning in the program.

As for the cons, the largest is definitely the intense and disheartening aspects of the assessment structure of the curriculum. Personally, the assessments were the most important reason that I spent so much time working and studying outside of class hours. This is because if you fail two assessments, plus a single retake opportunity, you are dismissed from the course. With a weekend full of intense studying, I personally found the assessments to be fair and the course will give preparation materials that strongly correspond to the actual assessment. On the other hand, sometimes peers cannot make it through the grind of assessments: I believe that these individuals that were dismissed from the program do have the potential to be good programmers in the working world, and it was likely the pace of the curriculum, more so than its sheer technical difficulty, that was the largest hump to get over. Overall, my advice to prospective future students is that if you are confident in your programming abilities coming into the first week of the program, expect to still spend a lot of time on assessments and digesting the enormous amount of material from the week prior. If you are coming in less-confident, or even worse, having rushed through the four weeks of prep work, then expect to spend an extraordinary amount of time (and lack of sleep) on keeping your head above water. While the assessment structure does force students to master the material, for the most part, the stressful atmosphere that it creates through the whole school is an unfortunate trade-off.

Finally, I wanted to comment on the quality of the facilities, which is important because students spend most of their hours here. During my cohort, the New York office got a significant upgrade in amenities and privacy. Before, both concurrent cohorts shared a single loft space with poor water pressure, mediocre bathrooms, and sometimes inconsistent internet. Now, each cohort gets their own floor to work on, and the office space includes a decent kitchen setup outfitted with utensils, plateware, drinking mugs/glasses, and a dishwasher. Most importantly, the coffee and teas offered by the building were significant upgrades over Folgers and Lipton. These small touches, for me, actually made a tremendous quality-of-life improvement; since most of our time will be in front of screens in the office, it’s good that the peripheral comforts are well-appointed.

All-in-all I would recommend App Academy to those who want to make a tremendous career shift to a good field in the least amount of time possible. My warnings are regarding its pace, difficulty, and the toll it can take on your personal well-being.",11/6/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239348,2017.0,True,Is it worth it?,"Everything you've read about App Academy is probably true. The hours are long, the course is intense, and for some people it's probably the most difficult thing they've every had to do. But more importantly, most people who have gone through it will agree that it was the best decision they've ever made and I can definitely agree. 

One of the greatest things about App Academy is the fact that they have the same goals as you: to land you a job. This is especially true when students (most usually do) take the deferred tuition model, which means not paying full tuition until accepting a full-time job offer. You can really tell that everything they do is to try to set you up for success. The work space is available 24/7 and there's always a TA available to help, whether it be in person or on Slack. 

It is important to note that while everything is laid out for your success in the course, how far you'll go is 100% dependent on the work that you put in. Due to there being no grades (aside from weekly assessments), it is sometimes easy for students to overlook some homework assignments and projects. If you're someone who likes to barely scrape by and do the bare minimum, then you're going to be in for a bad time. I had a few pairs I worked with that did not complete any readings and seemed very behind and those people ended up being the ones asked to leave after failing two assignments. On the contrast, those who study JUST for the assessments and put other parts of the curriculum on the backburner may pass all of them, will sometimes end up hurting themselves during final projects and end up having to relearn a lot of concepts that were not covered in the assessments. You really do get what you put into the program and knowing/balancing what concepts to focus on becomes a really important thing to learn over the course of the 12 weeks. 

Overall, App Academy was definitely worth it for me. If you're looking for a change in your life and you think that web development may be for you, I would urge you to apply. If you get through the application process and get accepted, the only thing that you will need to get all the way through the course is having the right mindset.",11/6/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239343,2017.0,True,"Challenging, Unique, and Wholly Worthwhile","My background and context: I come from a very non-technical, liberal arts background and my first time ever coding was about 5 months before my cohort started, while I was preparing for the JumpStart course (if you get invited to take part in JumpStart, I HIGHLY recommend doing it - you get a great taste of what the real program is like, including overall instruction-style, assessments, pair-programming, basic material, etc. and it reportedly greatly improves your chances of getting accepted into the program). 

Review: Overall, I would say that App Academy lives up to its ranking and is a great experience for turning someone like me, with absolute minimal tech / coding background, and in just 3 months turning this person into someone who can create a web app from scratch and can comfortably apply to jobs in that field. That being said, everything everyone says about the workload and intensity is completely accurate and you need to take it seriously. I gave up the vast majority of my life's activiities outside of a/A out of necessity - you really need to put in every weeknight and most of your every weekend into catching up if you're behind, getting ahead if you're not, or studying for the next week's assessment. Being someone who wasn't as naturally gifted or previously trained in the field, I had to work much, much harder and put in way more effort than those people so that I could still contribute and be productive in my daily pairings, projects, assessments, etc. 

Pairing - I found the pair-programming experience to be one of the most educational and enjoyable aspects of the program. Every day you are assigned a new partner to work with for the entirety of that day. You work through (and rarely complete) all of the day's projects together and over that time end up learning a lot, both about the person and about the day's material. Whether you find yourself to be the faster/more knowledgeable of the pair, or the slower/less knowledgeable, you end up learning at least a few things by day's end. Sometimes your partner will know a few cool keyboarding shortcuts in Atom that you hadn't seen before, or they will know some tidbit about Javascript formatting that you end up following yourself every time after, or they will have some alternative strategy to solving a problem that you find much easier to follow than the normal methods. I didn't have a single bad pairing experience in all 7 weeks of my pairings, half the time you end up eating lunch with your partner and talk, and most of the time by the end of the day you end up befriending one more person in your cohort. While everyone is learning the material at different speeds, you find that there are no ""dumb"" people in your cohort, every one is highly intelligent in different ways; they are the 2% that made it in with you and each is inherently capable of getting through it. 

Assessments - The assessments were definitely one of the more difficult aspects for me. The assessment policy is: out of 6 assessments in the first 8 weeks of the program, if you fail 2 of them (failure usually being defined around 85%), you are asked to leave the program, that day. This is where I find my only cons with the program. Having to leave the program that day, in front of all of your classmates, is downright brutal and borderline humiliating. If anything it motivates you that much more in your studying to avoid such an experience but I still think it is overly harsh - a simple email that night instead would be a less degrading situation, in my opinion. I also don't like that because of this intense ""Survivor""-style policy, I was often put into the very difficult situation of having to choose between fully completing the readings/videos, and hw assignments for the weekend, or studying sufficiently for that week's assessment to avoid expulsion. While I tried to balance this as best as I could and ultimately did make it through, I hated having to make that decision each week and having to compromise my getting-ahead for that week. 

To get you through all of it, there is an amazing team of warm, highly-gifted instructors and TA's who come to your aid either in person or online at the push of a button and explain concepts and bugs to you until both of you are confident that you fully understand, all of your highly-motivated, chill-mannered classmates, and of course, Google :).",11/6/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

You will not have time to achieve mastery of a topic before moving on to the next. If that's a problem for you, walk away now and pick a slower-paced course. You get the first taste of a new topic in the homework, the second taste in the lecture, and the third taste during the daily pairing project. There's a lot of stumbling, and that's ok -- the course is based on repetition, so you do pick up the skills, so long as you put the time in.

239341,2017.0,True,"Extremely tough, but rewarding, experience","Let me say in advance that I think the program itself is superb. The Teaching Assistants all know what they're talking about, and are very good at answering your questions and clarifying your understanding of things. The course material is all excellent, and by the end of the course, you'll have a strong understanding of vanilla javascript, ruby, rails, and using it all together to create an app or service from scratch. AA does a great job teaching ruby, rails, React + Redux, and putting it all together in a final package.

However, while the material is all superb, the downside is the extreme pacing and difficulty. You will easily do 12-14 hour days of non-stop coding, studying, etc (with the occasional breaks for sanity, of course). I would only recommend this program if you feel that you are completely prepared for the sheer intensity of the program. You learn a lot, and you have to learn it fast. If you fall behind, material quickly snowballs, and you'll be left behind. I cannot stress enough how important time management, and being prepared for the workload, is for to get the most out of this experience.

Having a very good grasp of ruby, javascript, and a basic understanding of how the internet works, will help a lot to prepare for what you'll encounter. Prior experience helps a lot. If you aren't good at typing at a decently fast pace, practice. Make sure you're fully prepared before coming in, or else you might be in for a rude awakening.",11/6/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239340,2017.0,True,Best learning experience of my life,"For context: I came straight out of college with a degree in pure mathematics, a significant history of programmatic thinking, and a few years of basic programming experience and game development in some unconventional languages under my belt, so I ended up being one of the faster ones. However, I'll write the review from the perspective of my classmates since I understand that the majority of applicants don't have technical backgrounds. I'll cover the scary before I cover the positives.

You need a lot of grit, determination, and motivation. The overall pace of the course is extremely fast, and it challenges your studying habits and your ability to overcome nearly incomprehensible material being thrown at you at lightning speed. 9 hours of class time per day along with hours of homework each night means that you end up eating and breathing code for 70-90 hours per week. Weekly assessments are given to ensure that everyone is on track, and two failures means you get removed; about a dozen people from the cohort didn't make it to the end and it kinda sucks seeing them leave. You could feel the stress hormones through the roof, and over half of the cohort experienced failing one assessment and the doomsday mindset that followed. There was an unfortunate tradeoff between fully understanding the material and studying for the assessments, and most people opted for leaving the understanding to after the assessments were over. I did not experience the stress that most people did, but it's common enough to be worth mentioning. 

That being said, the amount that you end up learning is quite impressive. No one could learn all this through self-study at the pace that they teach it here. At the end of nine weeks, I found myself with a fully functional single-page web app built on Rails and React/Redux, which was super cool (too bad they don't teach this kind of stuff in college). The pair programming was also a great experience - you find yourself developing soft skills and becoming more eloquent at communicating, which are of utmost importance to the job search. My classmates were all super chill and bright folks, and it was an absolute pleasure to be working alongside them and pairing with them every day. I can't say I miss pair programming, but I can say I enjoyed it a lot and experienced a lot of growth that I never experienced when I was self-teaching programming.

I feel prepared for the job search, and I know that I will be much more successful in the search than I would have been had I tried to pursue this path through self-study.",11/5/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239331,2017.0,True,Highly recommend,"This program requires quite a bit of work and effort, but it is worth it. Coming in, I had very little notion of what it meant to write good code or build web applications, but I have learned a lot through this process. The highlight for me was the curriculum. We start off learning basic Ruby syntax and object-oriented programming, move on to (a very light sprinkling of) algorithms, then Rails, user authentication, javascript, and finally React/Redux. In retrospect, the structure of the curriculum makes it feel like you learn the building blocks of web applications from the ground up. I have a lot (a lot!) to learn, but aA has definitely brought me to a good place in terms of self sufficiency. 

Things to note: 
- If you fail two tests, they will kick you out (no exceptions). They want everybody to be at least getting 85/90% on everything. This is sad if you start to befriend someone who then leaves...
- Shortcuts are great. Learning small shortcuts on Mac has improved not just my coding flow but also my own experience browsing the web. 
- You really have to spend a lot of time on the program. I had been living in NYC for a couple years before aA, so early on I just got used to telling friends that I couldn't hang out for like another month or two. That being said, if you do a good job studying you can usually buy yourself some weekend time (e.g. I attended  few parties and weddings during the course). 
- Expect collaboration. You are pair programming everyday, which means taking turns 'driving' an 'navigating' every 15 minutes or so.

I am sure that the other reviews all say very similar things and that you don't have to know that much about programming to be able to finish this course. I agree though I would add an asterisk. There are 3 ways to successfully complete this course: 1. You can be an insanely fast learner, 2. you can already have experience in the field of software development, or 3. you have to be almost bulldogged in your persistence. Everyone in my cohort was a joy to work with and they were all super smart and super helpful. The test structure forces you to learn the test more that learn the fundamentals. While this causes stress, and the experience of losing classmates to the rigid testing system was awful I feel like it is in place to maximize the schools success rate. If you are smart you can make it, if you are a coding enthusiast already you can make it and if you are super persistent, you can make it. Those are the people that are most likely to get jobs and be successful. Overall I feel like I have learned a lot and that I have at least the ability to continue learning and improving. 

I would like to leave you with 2 main take aways. 1.  if you are ready to change your life and are committed to taking advantage of every resource you can then prepare and be committed, otherwise go to a different program. 2. the program was super stressful but also the most enjoyable learning experience that I have ever had. I feel that this has everything to do with the selection process, the other students and the TA's.",11/4/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239304,2017.0,True,App Academy is an opportunity to work hard.,"Full disclosure: I'm getting a hoodie for writing this review. I don't believe that sways my opinion, but I feel it's fair that you know the context.

I'm writing this review having just completed my first 9 weeks of App Academy. In the last 9 weeks, (really 13 since there's about 4 weeks of prepwork assigned before the course starts), I've gone from 0 experience as a web developer to having created my own full stack web app using a Ruby on Rails backend with a React with Redux frontend. I can't speak yet to the quality of their job search curriculum, which I will go through over the next 3 weeks, but I will say that their full stack curriculum is absolutely effective for a few reasons. First, you should know that some of the students, roughly 15% in my cohort, were dismissed for not passing assessments before completing the curriculum, so being accepted is only the beginning of the journey. The ones who made it through are absolutely better programmers for having gone through the program. Many of my classmates started with little to no experience programming, and are full-fledged web developers now.

I believe the reason a/A is so effective is, in a word: reps. Every day, there are 2 hours of lecture, and then you peer program for 5-6 hours. Then there are homeworks and readings to do before you get to class. Shower, sleep, and repeat for 9 weeks. Peer programming is a process through which you sit down and talk through and try to solve problems with someone else. There are many factors conducive to learning and skill development at play during this time. First, learning to verbalize your approach to a problem is immensely helpful to refining and solidifying knowledge. Second, having the accountability to keep trying to solve the problem and having help when you need it keeps the learning process moving. Third, an understated part of programming is looking up and researching documentation, which you will get a lot of practice doing. Last but not least, you are experiencing the same thing while you drive and your partner navigates, so you have the benefit of differing perspectives every day. Before I started a/A, I thought these skills were something I could learn on my own, but would be faster with a teacher. That's partly true, but it's also true that your fellow students aid in the learning process immensely. If I were describing a/A to a prospective applicant, I would tell you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to work hard and learn. That's all it is. It's intense, but if you make it out, you will have absolutely developed hard, bankable skills as a programmer.",11/4/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

Although it is hard, the staff and everyone else involved are very supportive. The atmosphere is very open and welcoming and I never once felt like an outsider. The work load is extremely tough,  during my time here I rarely left before the 12 hour mark. Needless to stay my work ethic has never been better. Anyone with the right aptitude can get in.

239316,2017.0,True,Prep course is awesome! Alvin and David are the best!,"I graduated Prep Course at App Academy and don't regret it AT ALL! I tried studying by myself before and couldn't do it properly because you are new and you don't understand what to learn and what to skip. You spend days to understand the piece of new information which you even don't need. Sometimes people saying ""It is so a lot of info on the internet, why you pay extra money for studying in-person?"". So I can say, it is not just info, it is the new conception of thinking, and sometimes it is hard to get this new conception. That's why you pay money to get it faster, to spare time. Nobody saying you MUST go to the Prep or Bootcamp, you can study everything by yourself but you will spend 1-2 years to get a point where you will be ready to show your skills and knowledge to be hired and to be paid. What if you will put exactly the same effort and Prep and Bootcamp? You spare time! You will find a job already in 6 months after you start. Here is the difference in one and half of the year if you would do it by yourself. It is tens of dollars...  

So for me, it was hard to decide for Prep... now I don't have any doubts about spending this money for Prep and especially for Bootcamp.

Anyway, at the Prep App Academy, Alvin and David will prepare you for Bootcamp, they will tell you what to do and how to do, and you won't waste time for trying to pass a technical interview. Especially because you can't try every week.

And the last thing was very important to me - I stopped frustrating! That's it!!!! I started coding with confident and solid understanding what I am doing. The teacher (Alvin) and his assistant (David) are great guys! Very patient and smart people! A lot of stuff from inside of Bootcamp Immerse.

238451,2017.0,True,App Academy Bootcamp Prep Course,"The bootcamp prep course with Alvin (and David as our TA) did exactly what it said on the tin - got me into my top choice coding bootcamp (within 2 months of starting the course)! The curriculum takes you from complete beginner to Bootcamp ready, moving at a pretty quick pace at first, but with plenty of time to solidify and practice what you have learned over the 4 weeks. The material is thorough, however there are a few topics you will have to invest a little more time into if you are interested in schools other than a/A - but nothing you can't handle with each invidividual school's prep material. 

Alvin and David were both awesome. Patient, supportive, serious about the work but also lighthearted in their approach.

239317,2017.0,True,An amazing opportunity if you put in the work,"For a long time, I liked the idea of working in tech, but thought it was nearly impossible without a CS degree. However, when a friend told me about App Academy, I thought it was an interesting opportunity, although I was skeptical at the time.

The program itself is very intense, and will definitely consume your life for the 12 week duration. In the beginning, you'll learn about various CS fundamentals and the inner workings of several languages and frameworks, so just when you finally become comfortable with one thing, something new comes up. I think this is good preparation though, because working as an engineer requires one to constantly learn and adapt, so it's a good habit to develop. Towards the end of the curriculum, everyone makes their own projects, which is a great culmination of the skills you learned. Overall, I enjoyed my time at a/A, and I thought that the program was taught well and that the instructors were great.

The job search is definitely the roughest part of the journey, but a/A is there to help, and it does require a serious amount of discipline and patience. In the end, almost everyone I was in the program with has jobs that they enjoy, and I'll be starting mine in a bit. I think attending a/A was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'd do it again.",10/23/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
239019,2017.0,True,App Academy was awesome! I learned to develop web apps from scratch in just twelve weeks.,"General Summary:

      I wholeheartedly enjoyed my twelve weeks at App Academy. The program provides an intense, unique experience. Basically, it lasts twelve weeks: the first nine weeks comprise the “Technical Curriculum” and the last three the “Job Search Curriculum”. However, after being admitted and accepting your offer, you have to complete a one-month online course called “Alpha Prep” before starting.
      The technical curriculum is intense. In seven weeks, you will learn all the material you need to be able to develop your own React/Rails web app from scratch in the eighth and ninth weeks. On a daily basis, you will have many projects (whose material you covered in readings and videos the night before) to work on with your partner. You’ll learn Ruby, Postgresql, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React/Redux.
      However, pair programming and the “question button” system serve to alleviate some of the stress of the course. Pair programming is basically you coding on a single pc (and keyboard) with a partner. Every fifteen minutes, you switch “drivers”, i.e., the person who is physically typing on the keyboard. For the first couple of days, you might feel uncomfortable having to code all day with a partner, but the benefits of doing so become apparent soon after. Having to verbalize and communicate problems to someone else rather than hacking away at the keyboard forces you to become methodical in your approach, and it helps you ask better questions when you’re stuck.
      The “question button” is a button on the internal web app that puts your name on a question queue. The TA’s are pinged every time a person is added, and they come by to field students’ questions on a first-come, first-served basis. The benefit of this system is that it allows all students an equal opportunity to have their questions answered and it deals with the issue of less vocal or visible students receiving less attention.
      The job search curriculum begins in the tenth week. By that point, you will have learned all the skills you need to develop fully functioning web apps from scratch. However, simply because you have learned the technical material doesn’t mean the course becomes less intense. In these three weeks, you will work on your résumé, cover letters, online presence, personal pitch, and whiteboarding problems. In this aspect of the course, you will receive a lot of support from the career coaches. They will review your projects portfolio, résumé, etc, in depth and will give you detailed pointers on how to improve each item.
	

Pros:
	
The TA’s are always on call, and they generally are able to pinpoint your problem within seconds and do not leave you until all your doubts are assuaged.

Almost the projects serve some practical use, and the emphasis on repetition ensures that you internalize the material.

Pair programming makes the experience more enjoyable, and it ensures that you rarely get bogged down with trivial bugs.

The career coaches provide a lot of support in the job search. They help with your portfolio, personal pitch, networking skills, online presence, and negotiation.

App Academy’s alumni network is helpful and supportive.


Cons:

The curriculum is constantly being updated so sometimes you will find some inconsistencies in the material. This problem does not appear so much in the 12-week program itself, but it is definitely noticeable and distracting in the Alpha Prep course. 

As much as I love pair programming, you will have days where you work with someone you find intolerable. Fortunately, this only happened to me three days out of the roughly 35 in which you pair program, but this experience is variable.

There are six assessments throughout the course, and they are a bit stressful because if you fail any two of them, you are asked to leave the program with your initial deposit refunded. Moreover, because they are graded automatically, they are unforgiving--meaning that a single typo can cause code with otherwise sound logic to fail their automated tests. However, the expectations of the assessments are straightforward and you are given plenty of time and material to prepare for them.

Caveats:

If you are not an independent learner, you will have a hard time at App Academy. Despite the great amount of support you will have, there is a lot of material and little time. If you assume App Academy is like a traditional educative program where the student plays a more passive role, you will likely struggle through it. This is not a criticism of the instructors (I hold them in high esteem), but it is simply the nature the program.

You will not have time for anything else. This is not an exaggeration. I taught myself to code for half a year before attending App Academy so the first three weeks were relatively light for me. That being said, I was only able to have weekend evenings free during this time. When it came time to create our web apps from scratch, I literally had no time for anything else even on the weekend. 

Some people assume that the job search curriculum is less intense than the technical curriculum. This is not true so don’t get your hopes up!",10/22/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
238895,2017.0,True,App Academy Review,"I was part of the May 2017 NYC cohort and had an amazing experience. I put in a lot of hard work, often not getting home until after midnight but It was so rewarding that It felt like I was just having fun.

Cons:

1. The rigors of the job search. For me, the most difficult part of the entire process was the job search. I enjoy coding and solving problems but I absolutely hate sending emails and writing cover letters to try and 'sell' myself. This is not something specific to App Academy, but it is something to be prepared for. It took me over two months until I got an offer that I was happy with. About half of my cohort had to wait even longer. I know that doesn't sound like a long time but it IS when you're going through it. There were times that I didn't get any responses for weeks at a time and felt like I would never find a job.

Pros:

1. The tuition model. I applied when the tuition was 20% of the starting annual salary of the job I accepted. (They actually proactively lowered it to 18% because some students in my cohort had applied at that rate). For me, the low-risk payment model removed one of the greatest barriers to entry. It also gave me confidence that our goals were aligned and that success rates advertised were accurate (I too was skeptical before I experienced the outcomes first hand).

2. The students. Once I got in, I began to appreciate that App Academy sets a high bar and selects only the top 3% of applicants. Learning with a group of talented and intelligent students becomes a real advantage when you get stuck, don't understand something, or just need to discuss a concept.

3. The curriculum. The learning at App Academy follows a pattern of learning new material for homework, clarifying the details in the morning lecture, and hands-on experience in the afternoon projects. The curriculum is kept up to date with the latest stable technologies and focuses on applying the knowledge. For me, this helped in retaining what I had learned and cumulatively building upon it.

4. The career coaching. My App Academy career coach was AWESOME! The career coaches help students polish their resumes, online profiles, and cover letter templates. They also help to find and fix the bottlenecks in the job search. (For me it was the online profiles and resume. For others, it was practicing technical interviewing or adding features to their showcase projects). They give personalized advice and help keep graduates motivated when they're going through a rough patch.",10/17/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
242967,2016.0,True,"Really supportive program, learning how to learn.","App Academy is terrific. I almost failed out of App Academy due to failing assessments, and spent more time job searching than most of my classmates. But because I had a really solid support system, from the friends I made to the job placements team, I finally secured a job that I'm excited about. 

Back when I started in September 2016, if you failed two assessments, you were kicked out of the program. I was a pretty poor test taker due to high anxiety. When I failed my second assessment, I prepared my things and said my goodbyes. Thankfully, App Academy scheduled a retake, and I aced it. Now, I hear the retake policy is more lenient. My advice: take the practice assessments as many times as you can, and the chances of failing are much lower. 

I spent 10 months searching for a job. When I started my job search, my soft skills were weak, and my technical skills needed a lot of improvement. I practiced around 3 times a week doing practice interviews and white-boarding with my friends using Skype. My coach taught me how to sound prepared and confident on the phone, and checked on me weekly to see how I was doing with my job applications. 

The job search team also schedules mandatory workshops for job-seeking graduates to learn new skills and review concepts. They provide a really comprehensive list of networking events and meetups in the Bay Area where you can meet potential recruiters and other engineers. They're also some of the nicest people I've met; sometimes they'll just chat with you in the hallway and ask how you're doing.

The program is a proven formula that works and graduates are able to be hired into great companies as long as they continue their studies after the program.

242969,2017.0,True,What Happened to App Academy,"A/a prep course is great exp. Alvin is awesome...but they fall short on alot of things

1) They are the most expensive prep course-$2,999.00 …….(hack reactor’s prep by the way does the pre-course work with u so u can just join after is $250….FullStack is $650) 
	A/a has great teaching the they take the time to go thru everything with u but u learn a lot less topics..

2)They are very limited they skips concepts like testing recursion things which are need to get into hack reactor and full stack.

3)The guarantee to get into the top coding bootcamp always includes a a bootcamp that is very easy to get into and sometimes may not even require a technical interview.

A/a Immersive Review

1.) Even though they claim to update their CURRICULUM according to industry trends it hasn’t really change much. After speaking with alumni from A/a they themselves said they would have rather learned full stack javascript…and that it is easier to find a job with full javascript rather than ruby….heres are two link on industry trends….

http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/
2.) Their CLASS SIZE is one the largest of the coding bootcamps in NYC. Even though on this site it says class size of 40 its actually about 60 - 80…this is what I saw when I was there and what their instructor and students told me when I asked…Now does it matter YES absolutely now they will say we have a good teacher to student ratio but that only because they hire their own grads to as TA which isn’t really the same as instructor….second on hiring day you have a 60 -80 of your peers in competition with u to get into a company….. Hack Reactor has less 30 students per cohort and they do this on purpose to bring out great quality grads…full stack is less as well I’m not sure on the exact number..

3.) CLASS HOURS App Academy is open 24/7 BUT their daily schedule is Mon to Fri 9a.m. to 5p.m……Hack Reactor and full stack is Mon to Fri 9 a.m. -8 p.m. and Sat 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

4.)TUTION …App Academy had recently switch from 22% first years salary to a flat 28,000 on the deferred payment model…which is ludicrous…it because of state regulations but 22% of 100k salary job is not 28,000 even if u have a 100k job u really only bring home about 70K…this ridiculous that they would charge such a high amount.

Most of my friends from the prep after learning all these thing would not attend App Academy.

238471,2017.0,True,Hardest I've ever worked. Learned a lot. Got a job.,"Full disclosure, I'm not the typical bootcamp student because I had lots of previous coding experience and even some development work. Went to a/A because I was doing QA and hated it. My previous experience undoubtedly helped me land a job after the curriculum was completed but a/A helped me gain a lot of skills and knowledge that I was lacking before.

App Academy was the hardest I've ever worked in my life but in a good way. I really felt like I was learning and retaining what we were being taught. Be prepared to work you a$$ off! It's 9-6 every day for 13 weeks and you will spend every moment outside of class studying. Get a haircut before the course starts because you won't have a free minute!

Also be warned that your continued enrollment in the course is subject to a strike system and doing well on coding assessments. The assessments are no joke and we lost about 8 people because of them. I studied every weekend for the assessments and had no regrets on that front. Strikes are for absences and lateness so be on time! People have been dismissed from the course this way.

The curriculum was interesting and my new job has even drawn on what I have learned there so it has definitely been valuable. I really like that they are constantly revising the course to ensure it is up to date and relevant. Almost every day was pair programming on projects which I think is a great way to learn since you don't have to struggle by yourself. One downside to the constant updating is that some of the curriculum is rough around the edges and it often seems like we were only working on a given topic for 2 days at most before we moved on. It's easy to feel overwhelmed but your fellow students and teachers are always there to help you. They have office hours everyday and people often stay late to do homework together if you need it. It helps to find people who live near you and make a study group.

It's also great that part of the course is focused on job search and interviewing skills because I never felt like I knew anything about this. It was very helpful to learn about writing resumes and cover letters. The job coach I had was really insightful and I owe him a lot. You'll get lots of whiteboarding practice too which is great because it's so awkward the first time you do it.

I met a lot of nice and interesting people and there's great diversity in the student body. The instructors are really dedicated and a/A recruits TA's from previous cohorts so they are on the same level and easy to talk to.

In summary, I really liked the course and I think if you are serious about becoming a developer it's a great choice. Some of the curriculum needed refining but they are constantly improving everything. Lots of support and teachers are great!

238097,2017.0,True,Great Experience,"I attended App Academy in July 2017. Overall, my experience was positive and I think the course gave me the tools I need to get a job as a web developer.

Pros: 
- Great curriculum: The pace is extremely fast and it constantly feels like you're barely keeping up but the structure of the course with the weekly assessments keeps you on track and at the end, you realize you know more that you think you do.
- Great staff: The Instructors / TAs are available to answer questions throughout the day and they're good at helping you arrive at the right solution to the problem instead of feeding you the answers.
- Projects: You leave the program with 3 projects on your resume which you've built on your own.

Cons:
- As the other reviews mention, expect to spend 90+ hours a week doing this. You will have very little time to do anything else.
- With the speed of the course and the weekly assessments, it can be very easy to fall behind and there's little to no time to catch up.
- The end of the course can seem a bit rushed as you rush to complete your resume and portfolio and start applying to jobs.",9/21/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

238033,2017.0,True,Incredible Experience - Definitely Worth It!,"There's a handful of coding bootcamps out there, but App Academy stands alone (for a good reason). What differentiates this program from all others out there is THE PEOPLE. The way they achieve an incredibly diverse and hard working group of people is through the deferred tuition model coupled with the selective process to get in. This creates an assemblage of some of the most intelligent, kind, and hardest working people I have ever met. The curriculum is perfectly planned out and constantly adapting to the coding environment out in the wild. The teachers know the material inside and out, questions are encouraged and a habit of collaboration is instilled. I can't thank this school enough.

It really is surprising how much material they were able to pack into three months. In a way it's almost too much to tackle at once; it takes a lot of mental and emotional fortitude to get through and really pushed me to my limits. I've made it through, but I came close many times to crashing and burning. It's probably the best way to start a career quickly in software development quickly. the catch is that it's only accessible if you can learn fast, set aside other obligations, and you have great mental health. From what I’ve gathered App Academy takes this to an extreme even compared to other bootcamps. 
The upside of being at App Academy is that you know they have your back. The students and TAs are very supportive of one another and will help see you through a multitude of challenges, technical or otherwise. The best part is that this support continues until you've accepted a job offer! Don't be afraid to open up to the TAs; they really are there for you.",9/20/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

It's very enjoyable to be able to build applications that we use in our every day lives.

237981,2017.0,True,Work hard and it'll pay off,"Pros: App Academy teaches you more information than you'd be able to pick up on your own. They consolidate the most important things in the industry, and package them for you to learn within a span of 8 weeks. However, even taking that into consideration, App Academy's greatest asset is the people. By that I mean, the instructors are extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and your fellow cohort members will be extremely hard working which will push you to work hard as well.

Cons: This will take over your life for 2 - 3 months. There are some outliers where some students get through just fine without spending 90+hrs a week, however for the vast majority, I'd say 90+hrs is the norm.

I feel like it filled in the gaps in my knowledge that made me able to be competitive for a job. I had tried to get a developer job by myself but didn't feel like I was prepared. App Academy gave me the needed discipline to put a portfolio together that I can be proud of.

I recommend anyone going into the course take some time to learn on their own. Even with a tech background the course was very intense and I can't imagine going in with no knowledge. Others were able to do this however but be prepared to work a lot.

237938,2017.0,True,Challenging but worth it,"I came in with a little bit of programming experience - enough to know a few basic data structures and the difference between HTML and Ruby, but as I soon learned, not very much at all. The amount of information I learned in the first few days combined to be more knowledge than I had about programming previously. The course has a ton of great TA's, so even if you are feeling overwhelmed, there's always someone to talk to for help. Classmates come from all backgrounds and walks of life, but pretty much everyone was the same beginner when sitting down at the computer to pair. Because everyone is there for the same reason (to learn and become developers) everyone is willing to help out each other. 
One warning: the course isn't lying when they say you will spend upwards of 90 hours a week programming. There is plenty of work to do outside of the classroom, and you'll want to do all of it to make sure you don't fall behind. The information is actually quite interesting and the lecture videos are well done, but it will be in your favor to keep on top of the work. 
There's also a great alumni network to help find jobs after the course is officially finished. Because App Academy is one of the few long-lasting coding bootcamps, companies have learned that their graduates are different than other bootcamp graduates and are more willing to give potential employees the time of day.
Overall, I had a great experience at App Academy. It nurtures a collaborative atmosphere unlike many other places of learning. Come prepared to class each day, get plenty of rest, and there's no reason you too can't succeed at App Academy.",9/15/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
237956,2017.0,True,"App Academy sets extremely high standards for students, then provides students with a means to exceed those standards","App Academy's curriculum is solid, and they're constantly improving it; the git repo for our location alone has over 5000 commits in under two years. The learning curve is best described as exponential, but nothing they teach is ever irrelevant or impossible. The lectures are stellar, and the optional QA sessions after most of them are informative and usually extend beyond their 30-minute time slot if students are extra confused. This speaks to the dedication of the staff to producing graduates that are not only capable, but who take initiative to fill the holes in their knowledge. 

Pair programming is mandatory during most of App Academy's curriculum, a standard that encourages peer teaching outside of the normal class hours. This vibe sticks around, resulting in students that aren't competitive, but rather truly cooperative. Much of App Academy's value lies in their philosophy of pairing and peer teaching. 

Before applying to App Academy, I had read all the common sentiments in their reviews: ""It was like drinking from a firehose"", ""You really will spend 100+ hours a week"", ""It was absolutely the most difficult and most rewarding thing I've ever done"". 

All those things are true. There were days when I hated this place, and there were days when I loved it, and I would assume the same is true for most students who go through this program. Some days the obstacles seem insurmountable and you wonder what you're doing here; other days you wonder why you ever considered doing anything else. App Academy is a world of extremes. With extreme frustration comes the extreme satisfaction in the truth of saying ""I can do this because I just did it."" Before coming here I saw a tweet that simply read ""Do what you can't."" With the help of amazing lectures, a world-class curriculum, and TAs bordering on (or crossing into) genius, App Academy helped me do what I thought I couldn't.",9/15/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
237906,2017.0,True,App Academy is Top Drawer,"When I was applying to boot camps, I did so simultaneously, to about 4 different boot camps. One of them accepted me right off the bat and I knew they were the wrong choiced. Others asked me to accomplish things in coding challenges that were far beyond my skill level without offering any instruction or legitimate curriculum. 

With App Academy, the application process was very challenging, but you are given every opportunity to succeed via their resources. Also, the actual challenges they give you are algorithm challenges, very similar to whiteboarding questions you may get when you interview for a Developer position. This is in contrast to other challenges that ask you to build a Rails Twilio application or some other project that is very practical in nature. 

Yes, building an application is a great way of finding out whether someone is a good programmer, but it tells you nothing of their potential. However, if you teach someone some basic programming principles and data structures: what is a string? an array? etc. and then ask them to solve a question that uses those data structures, it is a much better way to guage someones potential by seeing if they are capable of applying what they are learning. Building a full application is much too difficult a task to ask of a newbie without spelling out every step and at that point, you may as well just write the code for them.

So aside from the deffered tuition (which is nice), the application process is what got me hooked on App Academy.

Once you get in, first the first few weeks all you want to do is survive. You will be kicked out if you fail two exams. The first people to go are people who can't type (it's painful to watch them type with only their index fingers) and people who don't speak English as their first language. That's not to say that everyone who doesn't speak English as their first language will fail, not what I am saying. However, the sheer amount of information that will be thrown at you is mind numbing and every lick of it is in English. If there is no language barrier, you still only absorb ~75-85% of what you are taught. If there is a language barrier, that percentage drops. This makes it difficult to keep up in a very fast paced environment. I noticed the people who spoke English as a second language and did well in the class either had prior coding experience or were just insanely sedulous and dedicated to the craft. It can be done, but it is certainly harder.

Once you make it past the survival phase, which is after the fourth assessment (say week 4), then you start to think, ""Ok, I don't want to just survive anymore, I want to excel."" This is where the course gets really exciting because you begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You start to think about things like a programmer. You get re-programmed. That's what this program does to you, it programs you to be a programmer (you like what I did there?).

If you're smart, you may be wondering, ""Well what are some flaws, some bad things about App Academy"". The one thing I can point to, which I got over once I bought into the program is this: you are not attending a/A to create a startup when you graduate. I have a ton of ideas for startups, yes, but if it's one thing I learned during my time at a/A, it's that programming is very hard and it will take time (and more importantly, work experience) for you to be good. The goal of an a/A graduate is to get a job, not to start a company with a cool new application that revolutionizes an industry. Get a job, pay us back, get some experience, and then go start a company. That is the message and to be honest, I agree with it. Now some other bootcamps, like Full Stack Academy, have avenues for students to pursue their startup aspirations. This is a luxury that only a school who is already paid can afford. At a/A, they don't make money unless you do and most startups don't make money, they cost money (trust me, I know firsthand). 

Now, if they don't get paid unless you do, that means they have a vested interest in your getting paid. This system of deffered tuition is one that Milton Friedman espoused in his book Free To Choose. He devised this as a way to pay for education without the government paying for it, but admitted it would be very difficult to implement. Well, App Academy implemented and guess what, it works! The curriculum kicks ass. It is laid out in such a way that each topic builds on the next and moves very quickly so that every week your knowledge grows exponentially. I'm not going to go into specifics on the curriculum, the website does that. But I will say that I remember thinking often, ""Wow, this curriculum is so good."" Thank Ned Ruggeri et al!

237902,2017.0,True,The Future of Education,"After accumulating six figures of debt and few hard skills at college, I had developed a cynical attitude about education as a whole. I discovered an interest in programming at work and when I realized that I'd reached a limit in my capacity for technical growth, I considered my options. Another 2-4 years in college was a big no-no (fool me twice, shame on me) and, for similar reasons, spending 15-20k upfront on a bootcamp with no guarantee of success seemed like a bad bet.

App Academy was groundbreaking. For the first time, I found a school whose tuition model aligned with my own personal goals. The better I did, the better AA did.

The rumors are all true. No amount of words can describe the rigor and the challenge of the program. An 80-90 hour weekly commitment is typical. You'll lose sleep. You'll be challenged consistently and think ""I'm not sure I can finish this"". You'll be surrounded (and outcompeted) by some of the most gifted people you'll ever meet. You'll fail to understand a topic on a Saturday and pass an exam on it on Monday. Once the learning curriculum concludes, you're thrust into the job search, which is filled with entirely different challenges -- personal projects, phone calls, take-home assessments, technical screenings, whiteboarding sessions, in-person interviews, salary negotiations.

And then, almost miraculously, things start working out. You get complimented on your GitHub code at interviews, you do well at whiteboarding sessions, you get offers that are almost double what you earned at your previous job. You have the confidence to choose which offers to accept and which to reject.

A single review can't do AA justice. It truly provides a life-changing experience. The TAs are phenomenal --- amazingly brilliant people who not only understand the material but have a genuine desire to help others. The in-class pair programming assignments are perfectly structured; there is enough material to ensure a good 5-6 hours a day could be spent coding. The caliber of the students is phenomenal -- lots of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. The job placements team is stellar as well; all were confident career coaches that were eager to lift you up and fill you with optimism.

All in all, I have zero regrets about the program. All promises were kept. It was the most challenging educational endeavor I've ever attempted but, thanks to App Academy, I feel confident about my future as a software engineer.

237691,2016.0,True,Worth It,"The resources available are amazing. The curriculum is always changing to keep up with the latest technologies. As a result, it's not always the most polished, but it's probably the best way to learn the latest tech. This is facilitated by the amazing TA's who are always available, even outside of class hours via slack or email. My classmates were all awesome people and it was nice having a space to come in and study. (I hear they're upgrading locations again, too).

As for cons, the pacing of the curriculum was pretty bad, but they try to do their best to time assessments and projects to be as manageable as possible. Even then, because of the sheer quantity of materials to learn, it behooves you to keep up and understand where you're at as best as possible. I didn't find the curriculum to be too stressful coming from a specialized high school/ medical school background. I also had a basic understanding of a lot of programming concepts, so I was definitely at a bit of an advantage over my classmates who had to teach themselves the basics of coding a month or two before starting the course. Generally speaking, if you made it past the interview process, you've got what it takes to pass the course. The job support portion is nice, but there are a lot of students so it might be difficult to pin down subtle issues you're having with the job search. If you reach out, though, you'll get the support you need.

Some advice: SLEEP. Especially if you have an assessment the next morning. Your priority during boot camp MUST be in this order from most important to least important: Sleep, food, studying, everything else. If you do not sleep properly, you will not retain the information you're cramming, especially if it's all completely new. You will learn the most by doing what you read about the night before, and you won't be able to code the next day on no sleep and an empty stomach. Also, when you apply to jobs, apply to everything at once. You will have the best chances while all your projects are fresh. You have nothing to lose by getting in touch with hiring managers and CEO's of companies. Do what it takes and be sure to keep coding. Good luck.

If you're just starting off your research into boot camps, a/A is one of the best, especially in NYC. You will need to save up a lot of money in order to support yourself and pay a deposit.

237377,2017.0,True,APP ACADEMY CHANGED MY LIFE. Career Shifter - Biologist turned Software Engineer. It's possible!,"​App Academy was the best decision I made and it was such an amazing experience. I graduated college with a Biology degree and was planning to go to physical therapy school, but my grades and GRE scores were not competitive enough, so I felt stuck. I was looking for a career change and that's how I found App Academy.

I strongly suggest learning how to code a bit to see if you like it! I ended up finding it more enjoyable to learn than studying for my GREs. I've never coded before and I had no CS or SWE friends, but I followed my instincts and decided to apply to App Academy. 

For the interview process, I checked out the resources provided by App Academy to prepare for the coding challenges and found them helpful for getting a good start. I went through every possible interview round there was.. first it was a timed coding challenge which I passed, but decided to attend their Jumpstart program where you have the chance to be accepted straight into the program if you pass their assessments (Which I highly encourage if you can make it out to SF for two weeks - just email them for more information about it). Unfortunately, I didn't pass Jumpstart, so I returned to SoCal and continued with my interview process. I went through a live coding test, a homework assignment, a timed test, another live coding test, and then finally making it to the behavioral interview before receiving the acceptance email.

Program:
- If you are thinking about doing a career shift and have zero coding experience, know that it's possible but you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the material and not fall behind. App Academy will be difficult. They move at a really fast pace and it will be hard to keep up if you fall behind.
- Be prepared to have no life outside of coding for 3 months. Because they're also open on the weekends, I went to a/A every single day during the program. Take advantage of the study area since they have computers, a restroom, and a kitchen! Why go to a coffee shop and struggle to find open seats :) There were nights where I dreamt about code, went to sleep thinking about code, and woke up thinking about code. 
- Don't feel down if you see that those around you are doing a lot better than you, a lot of times I realized that those around me have either coded before, taken CS classes, or have prior experience. 
- Make sure to study well for the assessments, they are timed so make sure to practice taking them over and over and over again if you don't do well under pressure.
- Staff/TA was great! They split everyone into smaller groups, so there's a good amount of TAs per group. We had weekly circle time where we went around in a circle and talked about our week which I really liked.

Job Search:
- My biggest challenge was to study algorithms, data structures, and mostly CS concepts since I did  not have that background, but just study consistently the areas you feel you're weak at and practice. Set up a good routine and schedule for yourself.
- Constantly check in with your coach! Meet up to study and keep up the momentum or applying to jobs with your cohort mates. Support each other.
- Buy yourself a whiteboard to practice writing out problems. Be comfortable talking about yourself and your projects (it's going to get repetitive)
- I wanted to wait until I received a job offer to leave a review... so I am happy to say that after 4 months of job searching, I received an offer from a company I am super excited to work for! Thank you App Academy!",8/24/2017,Bootcamp Prep,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
237258,2017.0,True,Great first step towards a career in web development,"Writing this review 12 weeks into the full-time course I can honestly say that I was able to find a great deal of value from attending the course. Coming into App Academy with little programming experience, I've noticed my skillset improve week by week in a tangible way. My experience in interacting with the staff has been largely positive as well. The TA's are all very knowledgeable and great at leading you to develop a full understanding of the material that you are working on.  My favorite part of attending the program has been making connections with the other individuals going through the course. 

This program is definitely a full time commitment, and the workload estimate of 90+ hours a week is accurate. To anyone looking to attend the full time course, I highly recommend the program, with the caveat that you ready to dedicate 3 months+ of your life (not including the time spent job searching full time after the course),  eating, sleeping and breathing code.",8/18/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
237217,2016.0,True,"Useful, Structured program","I attended App Academy this past winter, and it was a great program start to finish. Some background on me - I was coming from a software background building ads in Flash. I never had any organized instruction in software, so I pretty much only learned what I dealt with on a day to day basis. After a few years, Flash was almost dead, and I knew I had to get my skillset more in line with the current tech ecosystem. 

I enrolled in App Academy, and start to finish it was an awesome experience. They had the right mix of lectures, well-written readings, and actual coding. Every day you'd be paired with a new partner, and then at night you'd have readings and homework to buff up your skills. It was a TON of work, but it was so busy and interesting that it never felt frustrating or overwhelming. It was just a matter of telling all your friends ""I can't hang out for a couple months,"" and then putting the time in. That's a tall order I'm sure, but I think it was worth it. I swear at one point during a break, I felt my brain tingling from all the thinking I had been doing.

Anyway, they taught a wonderful full stack curriculum that left me well prepared for coding challenges and interviews. It took me a while, but my new job is paying me 30,000 more than my previous software job. App Academy is an intense program, but for me it was one of the most personally rewarding decisions I ever made.",8/17/2017,Bootcamp Prep,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
237227,2017.0,True,Great Choice,"I am currently studying at App Academy. I think I have made a great choice. 
Curriculum:
The Curriculum is great and intense. Every night you will have homework and readings. Each morning you will have lectures and each afternoon you will do pair coding. Most of the time you won't complete the daily project
There will be 6 assessments and at least three large projects during the cohort. 
It's not a joke of drinking from the fire hydrant.  There is more and more stress every day.
No one is super confident through the whole cohort.   or understand everything  App Academy teaches you.  At some point, you will feel behind. The TAs will tell you it's normal.  You should believe it. At least I do. 
Do your best to learn everything. Use all your time to work hard on it and believe you could make it through.

Tomorrow is our graduation day.",8/17/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.0,[],4.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy
237226,2017.0,True,Trial by fire,"By now there are tonnes of reviews for a/A and they are all true. The problem lies in who exactly they are true for. We all come from so many different backgrounds and lifestyles that our experiences can vastly differ from the reviews we read. However, there is one constant among us, the will to learn software development and the hope to get a great job in the industry. While I can't really comment on the second aspect (haven't actually begun job hunting yet),  at the end of the day if you want to learn how to quickly and effectively develop software AND have a great time with your cohort mates and TAs, a/A is undoubtedly one of the best places you can choose to attend. 

A few caveats that you should pay attention to. You have to eat, sleep and breath code. You have to constantly give more and more of your time and effort as the course progresses. As soon as you think things might start slowing down and you might have room to breath, the course will get more intense. So one of the best advice I can give to any one who gets accepted into a/A: KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD, regardless of your daily schedule. The curriculum is one of the best, believe in it to teach you the skills you need as long as you can do what it tells you to do. On top of that the TAs (atleast in my ""pod"") are some of the nicest, smartest and the most knowledgeable people I have ever met. Use them.

The job search curriculum seems to slightly drop in quality (Not the lectures on actual job search, those are great, but the organization and content of that part of the overall course). The intensity never drops and you are forced to be more independent in your work, though do note that this is by design. You still learn buttloads of good stuff, especially on how to actually get a job which is what everything led up to. Despite that it feels a bit lacking coming from the main curriculum.

On a final note. There will always be times when you feel in over your head. There will always be times when you doubt your own ability. But if you are willing to ignore those thoughts and keep pushing through with the right mindset, trust me, you will become a software developer.  Hopefully I'll remember to update the review once I get a job. Until then, good luck.",8/17/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy
237188,2017.0,True,Best place to learn to code and become a web dev.,"Pros:
Great resources and environment - Curriculum is designed day by day and it is clear what to learn and practice every single day throughout the course, and it will lead you to be able to build the full stack application by the week of 10. If you get stuck (especially debugging), you can ask TAs and circle leader for help anytime, and they are experienced, welcoming and awesome to work with!
Cons:
Workload and assessment pressure - Even though the course ends 6pm, there are a lot of readings and homework everyday. If you can't commit 70 - 90 hours a week, you might feel behind or not ready for the assessment. Failing the assessment twice means having to leave the program, so there are a lot pressures to handle. 
Context:
I attended May cohort 2017. Prior to the actual program, I attended the 2 weeks program called Jumpstart, that teaches the basics of Ruby language to pass the border of admission. After receiving acceptance, I went through the online a/A preflight materials called Alpha course for about a month. Once the actual course starts, time flies so fast. I gave up a lot of things on weekends for the course, but making apps and solving problems is exciting and I currently enjoy working on the flex project with my awesome classmates. 
I could have done this much without a/A.",8/16/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
237103,2017.0,True,Definitely worth it,"As many others have already mentioned, this is a rigorous course that will require at least a 70-80+ work week. Despite the demands of this program, the experience has been greatly rewarding for me. After two months I was able to create a web app from an idea I had for a while (that was the reason for me pursuing software development in the first place.) The students you're around are also incredibly hard working and its inspiring to learn and work with them. 

Some side effects of this bootcamp: since the pace is so rapid it'll force you to confront with yourself with learning how to learn. It'll  also help teach you how to develop a strong work ethic that requires serious commitment and sacrifice. 

Downsides: the learning curriculum is done via pair programming with another student for six hours almost everyday. Although I see the value of pair programming forcing you talk through your ideas and working collaboratively, I also I believe learning should mostly be a personal experience and journey where you have the space to explore you're own thoughts on concepts. I wished pair programming happened only 2-3 days of the week instead of the usual 5.",8/16/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

I think people should take into consideration how much time and work it actually takes to succeed in the course. I wish though there can be more support and opportunities for women and minorities to succeed there. Over all, I do recommend the course, however, it is not for everyone.

It's been a really busy 12 weeks, but I've learned a ton in this time. Pretty much all weekday nights and most weekends will need to be dedicated to doing work, so be prepared for that if you decide to apply. The leturers, TAs, and the curriculum are all great. I think they try to teach you too much in a short amount of time, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. I do think that the cost of App Academy is must higher than most other bootcamps and the experience you get may not be worth the additional cost. Overall though, it's been a great experience.",8/15/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
237182,2017.0,True,Pretty Good,"TL;DR
Yes, you will learn enough at App Academy to find employment as a software engineer and earn salary at market rate, but be prepared to do a good amount of work on your own after the program.

I graduated from App Academy earlier this year. I was waiting until I found a job before I wrote this review. To be transparent, App Academy offers a free sweatshirt for writing reviews, regardless of rating, but my intention here is to share my experience and honest opinions.

Initially I applied to App Academy and Hack Reactor, as these appeared to be the top two bootcamps with the most rigorous admissions process. I ended up choosing App Academy because you learn two languages, Javascript and Ruby, and they offer tuition deferment.  

The curriculum is App Academy's best asset.  I can attest that they teach Ruby, Rails, SQL, and React very thoroughly. They lay a strong foundational basis for Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, and algorithms for you to improve upon later. And you will have to study some of these topics on your own to get to a level sufficient for employment, particularly when it comes to Javascript. 

Other positive points of the program include pair programming, supportive staff, smart cohort mates, etc. The staff for the most part consists of App Academy graduates, teaching and non. This is a double edged sword; on the one hand they know the curriculum very well, having gone through it themselves, but as most of them don't have industry experience, it becomes challenging when you have question beyond the scope of the curriculum. App Academy is also deeply committed to providing a safe, inclusive environment. They take violations of their code of conduct incredibly serious and as a female of color, I very much appreciated these efforts.

The job search curriculum is not as strong as the academic portion, but it is a work in progress and constantly changing. I was expecting App Academy to have built connections with recruiters and companies over the past several years, but that was not the case. There is a small team called Talent Match that does focus on outreach to companies, but no one that I know in my cohort or previous cohorts has found work through them. You are pretty much on your own in terms of finding and securing work. App Academy provides resources and suggestions on where to look for work, how to write your resume and cover letter, how to network, what networking events are happening each week, interview practice, etc. but this information is also readily available on the internet. They do have a relatively good alumni network (that's how I ended up finding my job) but that is mostly dependent on the individual and how willing they are to help others. I'd like to see App Academy have hiring partners that recruit directly from App Academy graduates and continue building their alumni network.

In the end, it took me three months to find a job, which is about average. For me, the job search was the hardest part. I had to do CONSIDERABLE additional learning on my own, with little App Academy structure and the entire reason I wanted to attend a bootcamp in the first was place was to have everything laid out for me. Recently App Academy added a job seeker program which was somewhat helpful in organizing my time and giving me some form of structure. 

From what I've seen, it's taking each cohort longer and longer to find work. Alums I spoke to from a couple years ago often found work within weeks. The first person from my cohort to find work took almost a month. This is no surprise considering the volume of students that App Academy and other bootcamps graduate every few weeks. The best piece of advice I can give here is to be prepared for that both financially and mentally. Also recognize that it really is a numbers game, the more jobs you apply to, the better your chances of an interview, and the more interviews, the better you get at them, the more likely you are to get an offer.

To address and/or echo some of the comments/criticisms that have made here. Yes, the 13 weeks are extremely time intensive and you will probably feel burned out at the end (I know I did). You don't have much time to recover post program/pre applying to jobs, however, I did find the staff accommodating and reasonable like humans, not like corporate robots. There are rules because students perform better when there are consequences but the rules are not so rigid that App Academy will not work you if have a concern.",8/15/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy
237157,2017.0,True,Believe the Hype - but get ready to work,"App Academy has life changing potential.  I think we can all agree on that given that the program offers to make you eligible for Software Developer jobs in the span of three months.  There are some caveats though.  I'll address the negatives of the program before I delve into why I think it is a fantastic program that everyone should consider.  

The a/A lifestyle is not for everyone.  Whether you are invited to Jumpstart, or make it through to receiving an offer, it becomes quite apparent that a/A does its best to recruit the best, brightest, and youngest to their program.  Completing this program fortified my passion for coding.  If you can't picture yourself coding from 9am-6pm (with a lovely 75 minute lunch) and then doing homework until 10 or 11PM every night, then you may want to reconsider.  The material itself is not super, super dense, there's just an absolute ton that they shove at you in 8 weeks.  In essence, be ready for your lifestyle to be a/A all the time.  Myself, and a lot of my cohort mates would take Saturday off and play basketball Sunday mornings - so I want to be transparent when I say that although it consumes your entire life, there are patches of time to catch your breath.  

The range of students also varies considerably, but by the end of the program everyone is committed to finishing together.  One fact that I heard a lot, yet still surprised me was how diverse the cohorts are.  Keep in mind software engineering is some really hard stuff.  Learning Javascript in one week is not for the weak, so it makes sense that a majority of attendees come from prestigious schools.  If that makes you wary, don't be.  We had students with backgrounds from MIT, Standford, Princeton, dozens of mechanical and electrical engineers, former employees at firms such as Google, Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey.  But we also had multiple  people who failed college, only attended community college, had never held a job more than 25k.  I think youre starting to get the picture.   The people that have a limited background in tech/engineering/coding do typically do better but that's true with most endeavors in life so I hope that doesn't deter anyone reading this.  What's vitally more important is being flexible and having a lot of drive.  There's not a person above 30 in our group, and it makes sense given that a lot of us dropped everything to come to a city with the highest rents in the country and a full-time curriculum to learn in a matter of months. It's overwhelming, and they specifically design it that way.  Again, I want to repeat that because people will bash a/A for stopping to help them when they're struggling, or going too quickly through the material, but they design the course to make it feel like you're always inches away from drowning.  They don't have time to make it easy because you're competing with unemployed young guns with a fancy CS degree and boatload of knowledge.

Their contract sounds strict, but when it comes down to it they really want to help you find a job.  If they had any loop holes they'd be exposed and taken advantage of.  You can't offer someone a free curriculum without being sure that they will do everything they can to go out and get that job upon completion.  Again, you have to be ready to work and that is even truer during the job search curriculum.  It's also worth mentioning, because people read too many marketing materials and get a ridiculous thought in their heads, that they will make 100k in 12 weeks.  There are probably 2-5 people in our graduating cohort (out of 70) that could obtain that.  The majority of graduates take 90 days to find a job so take that into account as you're doing your preparation.  

A few parts of my a/A experience that I am forever grateful for are the relationships that you make and the material that you learn.  It's actually pretty easy to show up to a place that day in and day out keeps trying throw more and more work on top of you.  The biggest reason is because you develop extremely close relationships with a lot of people as you tackle trial and tribulations together.  In the end, you enter the job market with a network of 1000+ a/A grads that know everything you went through.  Don't underestimate the people in your cohort.  A lot of us all came in with the same mentality of buckling down and getting the job.  Like actual software development, you need to rely on your team in order to achieve.

Every day is long and tiring.  Every day will waver your self-confidence and raise your level of impostor syndrome to unprecedented heights.  But every day is also extremely riveting and fulfilling.  You will do and create things you wouldn't imagine.   You find a way to get it done, and then you do it.  That's engineering.  That's innovation.

Any questions, feel free to shoot me an e-mail.  I was once in your shoes but somehow after twelve weeks of telling myself to take it one day at a time, I finally emerged as a software developer - and know that you can too.",8/12/2017,Bootcamp Prep,,[],,,,app-academy

The hours are not a joke. Expect to put in 80-100 hours a week on programming and do nothing else. Coming from a engineering background, I was really relaxed for the first two weeks, but the the program quickly outpaced my existing knowledge. I started learning completely new technologies every week, and got tested the following week on a decent level. The fast-paced program helped me learn a lot in a short period of time, which I definitely could not have accomplished on my own.

The people you meet here are incredible, I didn't think there would actually be graduates from Harvard MBA, Stanford, MIT, or ex-workers from Google, Pinterest.

The only thing you have to know that App Academy is still a company and it has to make profi. They try to pack a lot of materials into the job search curriculum where you build your javascript project and flex project, each in less than a week.

I went from barely knowing Ruby and some Javascript knowing how to make a fullstack web application (Ruby on Rails backend framwork and a React-Redux frontend architecture.) It wasn't soley about learning the material, you learn a lot of best programming practices, how to asymptotically analyze your functions and algorithms for time and space complexity,  and principles of OOP. 

Its great to know that their curriculum is updated with every new cohort (sometimes even during if a new technology is pressing enough.) 

Something to remember is its definitely a bootcamp. I was pulling on average 95-100 hour weeks to keep up. It made my experience in college seem trivial in comparison.

237040,2017.0,True,You get what you put into it,"Overall, App Academy is a great program: The curriculum is for the most part, adequately structured as well as relevant to the current web development market. The staff (especially the Teaching Assistants who all went through the same program) are excellent for the most part, and greatly benefit both struggling students as well as those who like to get ahead with extra material throughout the course. I attended this program because of its longstanding history of excellence in the job market as well as the deferred payment plan. Be forewarned, however, that in the interest of the company's business model, students under the deferred tuition plan WILL be expected to put in many hours during the job search, and will face a variety of pressures during the assessment as well as the post-program period as App Academy tries their very best to get you a job, so they can be paid in full. This may come as a surprise, but in the end benefits the student as they ALSO should want to find a job as soon as possible. Furthermore, the curriculum is only the barebones of what is expected of a constantly growing industry, and learning programs and technologies on the fly is essential to any software developer regardless of where they are at. Thus, the students attending should be aware of the fact that a job is not GUARANTEED in any way, and will need to put in EXTRA work during or after the program, no matter how intense the program itself is. 80-100 hours per week is NOT a joke, even for those who are ahead, as there are always things to be done, or learned. The more the student gets ahead while they know the material, the better their experience will be. All in All, App Academy is a great place to learn the basics of web development as well as the job search process, but like any other bootcamp, requires much more effort from the student themselves. I recommend that anyone thinking about applying also consider and prepare themselves to do nothing but eat, sleep, and code for at least 3- 6 months.",8/1/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy

App Academy is a boot camp (seriously). You'll average 60-80+ hours a week grinding through problems and concepts. You will have little to no social life. You will dream (okay, have nightmares) about code.

In exchange, you will become a better critical thinker and problem solver than you ever thought possible. You'll become acquainted with very exceptional people, and your mind will be blown away by people's genius.

The JumpStart or Bootcamp Prep admissions processes, while rigorous, provide a great foundation for the skills necessary to be successful at a/A. I've been both enrolled in and a TA for JumpStart, and I found the program as rewarding to teach as it was to learn under. 



The actual course is no joke. You'll get out what you put in, and be prepared to sacrifice 3 months of your life outside of learning & working. But rest assured: it is worth it. a/A imparts you with not only the technical chops to make it in the industry, but the job-searching, networking, and interviewing skills to get the job you want. After graduation, while working as both a JumpStart and BCP TA, I ended up with a total of 5 job offers, and currently have a job at a great company.

Learning how to code adds another layer of stress. So I really liked how App Academy began our course by stressing how they understood how difficult it can be, but not to give up. It seems so trivial, but for a team of ""techies"" to believe it's such an important topic to cover shows their compassion  in teaching people of all skill levels. That put me at ease early in the course.

I'm a beginning coder, with very limited experience so I had a lot of catching up to do to prepare for my bootcamp interviews. However, after these last four weeks in the bootcamp prep course, I am confident that I can tackle most problems, and for those I don't know, at least show my interviewer that I'm able to think like a software engineer by fully explaining my thought process. 

I've learned so much more in these 4 weeks than I ever would have been able to on my own in the same amount of time. I simply would not have been prepared to interview, now, however, I'm confident that I'll be accepted into one of the top bootcamps this coming fall. It's not easy, and I really liked how our teacher, Alvin, pulled no punches in forcing us to be clear in our code writing and explanation. It was like being in school all over again, but at a much higher level.

There’s no way I would’ve been prepared for an interview just from the book alone.  One piece of advice for how to succeed in bootcamp prep is to take the pre-course work seriously.  It’s important to hit the ground running because one lesson builds on the next.  Another thing to remember is how important practicing coding in your free time is.  Watching videos and attending lectures helps, but the best way to improve is by sitting in front of a computer, coding and debugging programs.

Campus - I attended the campus in NYC. It has great facility. Obviously there are enough computers for everyone, and there are private rooms for people to do phone screens and whatnot. 
 
Teachers - In general they are responsive, knowledgeable, and dedicated. However, sometimes some of them may act impatient and annoyed at you, which is simply unprofessional and immature given their profession.
 
Curriculum - The readings are easy to comprehend (until you get to the React/Redux part, which is not well explained). Video content is delivered clearly. The only bad part I can think of is that it is too fast. Sure, the majority of the students still manage to graduate and get high-paying jobs; but if the course had went 10% slower I think the learning experience would be much better, at least for me.

236506,2016.0,True,App Academy was one of the best decisions of my life,"What App Academy offers - a near-six figure salary on average within a year - sounds too good to be true. Three months after graduating, most of my classmates have accepted offers. I received my first offer two weeks after graduating. My job search lasted 2 months, during which time I received five offers in total. I am now happily working as a full stack engineer at a company I am excited about.
 
App Academy lives up to its promises because it has the brightest instructors and is built on top of a top-notch, stellar curriculum and an incredibly selective application process. My classmates are the most intelligent and talented group of people I have ever been a part of. Graduating from the bootcamp is only possible by setting your entire life on hold and studying and coding 11+ hours every day. Assessments are given weekly, and failing two of them leads to your dismissal from the program. You are expected to digest material very quickly and break your brain on difficult problems every day. The program is incredibly stressful and draining, but really does teach you what you need to know to get hired and grow as a developer.
 
A little bit about the curriculum:
The program is broken up into various sections, starting with computer science fundamentals, which focuses on problem-solving skills. Every day focuses on a project that usually involves pair programming. Pair programing helped us learn more quickly and communicate code clearly. The job search curriculum is very useful in guiding graduates in how they should use their time while job hunting.",6/18/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
236479,2017.0,True,Academy has been one of the best career and life decisions I have ever made.,"Prior to attending App Academy, I had a pretty solid foundation in CS fundamentals from a couple minors during my undergrad. After moving to SF and researching the skillset and breadth of new technologies in order to compete in the tech industry, I needed and wanted to learn more about the recent technologies. I chose App Academy because their top-notch curriculum is always adapting to what the industry dictates.
 
The three month boot camp really challenged me in my skills as a software engineer. The learning curve is steep, and App Academy is transparent as to the pace of learning needed to be successful in this program. You will be spending every day including weekends working on solo projects, group projects, and mastering new skills. The program goes fast and it is very easy to fall behind if you are not committed or do not do the work. You will not have a social life and will be expected to set aside “life” as all your time and energy will be dedicated to mastering skills and completing projects on time. Do not commit to the program if you are not ready to put all of your time and focus into the program.
 
A highlight of the program is their focus on your career goals. A focus on industry specific lectures will be given in how to master the application process to how to land the ideal salary.  The mentors will help you in setting yourself apart from the other applicants by refining resumes, creating the perfect cover letter, and making sure your portfolio is perfect. Tuition is based off your final offer from a company aligning a/A with your goal of landing a dream job.

Coding and learning for 12+ hours a day takes its toll and I did not take into account the burnout. I felt truly worn out within the first 2 months. Taking care of yourself is paramount, as the 13 week program is quite the marathon in itself.

One of the best things about a/A will have to be the people. Everyone I've worked with and spoken to have been incredibly eager to help one another. There is zero sense of competition. You will not only be pushed by the staff but also your own classmates and thats the way it should be.

Though the structure of the curriculum is not for everyone, it is constructed in a way that promotes efficient learning as you learn one concept and the next one builds on top of that.

236444,2017.0,True,"learned a lot, also hated it a couple times.","I am in the last weeks of my time at App Academy as I am writing this review. If you're considering App Academy, let me break it down for you.

first and foremost, I really did learn a lot.  It's hard to believe that I and my fellow students have come as far as we have in such a short time. As well as most students in my cohort, I had little programming experience prior to joining App Academy. Now, not only do I have a solid foundational knowledge of programming and web-development, I have the confidence and ability to read code docs and teach my self new technologies (a task that can be daunting to someone new to programming). On top of a functional knowledge of web-development, App Academy also teaches some basic computer science and algorithms, exposing me to fields of study I had never appreciated before.

That being said, It's really hard. Not just hard because of the sheer amount of knowledge you're expected to learn in such a short time, but the projects and hours are insane. It's not hyperbolic to say you will be pulling a few 100 hour weeks. You don't have time for a job during App Academy, even a part-time weekend job. You don't have time to hangout. You don't have time for anything. There were certainly a few times where I was running on no sleep, pulling an all-nighter, trying to finish all the work given to me, that I thought ""I don't even think I like programming anymore."" I still do, but the workload they give you at App Academy will definitely test your ability and patience. We made some cool projects, but halfway through them, I usually am done caring about them. If that's what it takes to get a project done, then maybe that's the price you pay, but I know that when the workload reaches a certain point, I just can't be motivated enough to care.

I will say a big part of App Academy is the job support. They really teach you how to get a job, which is another skill in itself.

The slight downside is that they can't teach you everything in 3 months. But that's why a passion for both coding and learning is important, so that you can motivate yourself to fill in any gaps or pursue and particular interests on your own.

236424,2017.0,True,Very Challenging and Very Rewarding,"There is a reason that App Academy is considered one of the premier coding programs in the country. If you get in, and make it through this rigorous, pressure-inducing curriculum (students who don't keep up are asked to leave), you're probably pretty good at the codes. But to make it through, it takes an incredible amount of tenacity and hard work, followed by an incredible amount of tenacity and hard work (for those of you in the biz- this is indeed recursive).

For 3 months, all you will be doing is coding. Tell your friends+family you will be unavailable for 3 months. I am very nearly not kidding. 90+ hour weeks are commonplace. You will immerse yourself in the curriculum, being helped along the way by a kind staff and supportive TAs.

One of App Academy's differentiators is it does not collect tuition from students until after they get a job as a software developer, and the amount it collects varies depending on the actual salary. So, they are heavily-incentivized to teach you cutting-edge technologies and do everything they can to help you become a skilled software developer, so that you can get offers at the top of the market at the program's conclusion.

For the first ~9 weeks, I wasn't sure that a/A was the best option. I still wondered what HackReactor was like. I wasn't sure about the bootcamp lifestyle *or* results.  Long story short: I wasn't sold by any means.

But now, I am. I do think a/A is the best choice, based on two things I experienced personally:
1. Job Search cirriculum is really powerful. After all, they don't get paid unless you get a job. They have a real motivation to get you a result. I'm not sure how that works at other bootcamps. 
2. They listen to student feedback. At the end of every week you fill out a survey with feed back. The cohort after mine had some pretty significant changes to their workflow based on our feedback. Not just bootcamps, but any business that actually *listens* to feed back and changes their product based  on that feedback deserves kudos.

I want to make sure that I'm not deceiving anyone. The experience wasn't perfect. There are some things that I didn't like. But like I said, they are legitimately improving the product every cohort. 

Advice for anyone thinking about going to a/A (or other top tier bootcamps): Don't under estimate how difficult it is, how much time it takes (14 hour days are average), or how much stressful it is. But also don't underestimate how drastically you can change your life in such a short time.",6/10/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
236415,2016.0,True,App Academy Review,"Attending App Academy's Immersive Course was a good experience that allowed me to learn the software developer skills needed for my growth in this field. Their curriculum provides a good base, but do expect to spend 60-80 hours per week during the three-month course including some time for self study. In addition to the education received, I made good friends and network contacts. I recommend App Academy's immersive course for anyone looking to take their career to the next level, but be mindful of the amount of work needed to realize personal success in this program.",6/9/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.0,[],3.0,4.0,2.0,app-academy
236414,2016.0,True,Taking the Plunge,"At first I was wary of the premise of coding bootcamps - learn the fundamentals of programming in 12 weeks and get a job?! It seemed too good to be true. But after reading more reviews and talking to a close friend who went through the program, it seemed like it was legit. Once I was admitted to the program and showed up on the first day, I was reassured to find out that the education - and the support - was solid. The instructors actually care about you learning to the best of your ability and finding a job. In fact, if you don’t find a job, the company loses money due to their delayed payment model, so it’s in the best interest for both you and the company to find a position. As a result, nothing about the program felt gimmicky or padded - everything I learned here helped me to develop my skills as a software developer.

Guys, this is the real deal. But let me give a caveat: to succeed, you have to give 100% of your effort. Don’t think that this program will magically help you get a job in a few weeks. It’s not that simple. The program will help you achieve great things, but only if you put in the work and the effort. Everyone in my class had to work their asses off and many people would stay in the office until 10 PM to get their work done or prepare for the next day. But in the end, all the time spent working and hustling will be worth it.

Since I’ve graduated over a year ago, nearly everyone in my class of about 50 students found jobs and are now working for a variety of different tech companies and startups. I, myself, found a job and am currently working for a startup as a software developer, and I had only started learning how to code a couple months before the program started. 

It IS possible to switch careers and find work as a software developer. Just have patience, tenacity, and a good work ethic, and you’ll be able to pull off amazing things.",6/9/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
236350,2017.0,True,"Physically and mentally exhausting, but even more rewarding","I had looked into a few bootcamps when I decided on App Academy. What really swayed me to go to a/A were reviews like this.  Actual grads that have jobs in the industry and can vouch for a/A. I was looking for credibility because I hesitant to make such a huge move in my life. I was looking for a good curriculum, and one of the best things about it in my opinion is that they have you work on projects, in which you can choose a new stack. In an industry that quickly changes, they've been able to not only maintain relevance but also provide real stats of their graduates success.

I expected this bootcamp to be hard, but they've pushed me to my limits physically and mentally. The curriculum is tough and the instructors are there to help. There's so much preparation you have to do just to not feel behind the next day. I've put in more hours into studying and coding daily than I've slept in a week. Ok, maybe thats a huge exaggeration, but I definitely put in the advertised 80-100 hours per week.

236335,2017.0,True,Great,"Being an App Academy student, I've experienced the curriculum full force, and I have to say, they have a very strong curriculum. For anyone who has some semblance of talent for coding and web development, it is very doable and highly recommended for anyone interested. Those who are less inclined may need to spend the advertised 90 hours a week. It is no joke of a bootcamp, and they do very well prepare you for what you will be entering. Personally, even if you pass the assessment barriers, it's still very much based on your own personal discipline. Some time off over the weekends is a nice stress reliever, but it's not a time to be partying. App Academy gives you the strong foundations, but there still needs to be a little more extra work to be a fully fledged software developer.

236322,2016.0,True,Very good experience,"The program definitely requires a huge commitment, in terms of time and effort. You are required to be in class every weekday and you need to be in San Francisco to attend the bootcamp. So, if you are not committed, it probably isn't the best fit.

The class itself moves super fast, so you have to constantly learn and absorb new materials. You likely will not have much time for fun during the 12 weeks bootcamp. However, the result is rewarding. You learn a lot about programming and the fundamentals. I found it easier to learn other languages and frameworks after going through the curriculum. 

Their financial model also benefits the students, so you don't have to pay until you get an offer. It helps to keep the bootcamp accountable.",6/1/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
236321,2017.0,True,It works.,"Like you, I was initially skeptical of coding bootcamps too, but I decided to take a leap with App Academy (especially since they offered a deferred tuition plan).

Prior to App Academy, I had zero coding experience. I spent about a month and a half studying to get in, then another month and a half to complete their prep work before day one. After admission, I had class from 9am - 6pm, followed by 1-3 hours of readings/homework for the rest of the evening. As other reviewers mentioned, it's quite the mentally and emotionally draining experience.

But stick with it. Their curriculum they offer is frequently updated. Their staff is accessible and passionate about what they teach. Their job support is awesome: daily whiteboarding and/or mock interviews, help with online presence (LinkedIn, AngelList, your portfolio, your GitHub, etc.), and personal career coaches help guide you through the process. 

To be honest, I also did feel like some of their initiatives in promoting diversity and welcomeness felt a bit forced -- but hey, it's the tech industry. Bottom line: the staff means well, they value team players, and they're committed to giving everyone the same opportunity to succeed.

Eight months ago, I knew absolutely zero about coding or web development. In a few weeks, I'll be starting my first job as a software developer. If you're ready to invest in yourself, it works.",6/1/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
236304,2017.0,True,"It's hard and not for everyone, but if you make it through, it will have been worth it.","This stuff is tough. It's going to take a lot of hard work and then some. The first week will seem very challenging. I think they do that on purpose to scare you into staying prepared. Weeks 3-10 are all just as hard if not harder. That being said, if you make it through the course, you will have learned the most you could have possibly learned about anything in 3 months. Their revenue is directly connected to the level of success of their graduates, which means they're well incentivized to provide as much job search support as they can, which they do with decently sized and well-qualified placements team. 

If I knew everything I did now 3 months ago, would I still come to App Academy? No, because i would have quasi-mastered software-engineering from the knowledge of going the through course once already. Anything I learn would likely be redundant with caveat that they actually do update and revise the curricula very actively, so there's good chance I could pick up something new and cool on the second round.

But if my mind was wiped of the technical knowledge but I kept my other memories? Well I'd be primarily concerned with what happened to lead that, but yes, I absolutely would.",6/1/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy
236303,2017.0,True,"Worth it, if you're ready","Not for the faint of heart or limited of drive, but if you're looking for a program to teach you a whole lot about coding in not a lot of time, you could certainly do a lot worse. The staff is technically minded and eager to help and the deferred payment model aligns company goals with your success, but the hours are long and the processes can be exceedingly grueling at times. If you are considering a coding boot camp, put App Academy up at the top of that list.

If you are looking to get into a bootcamp but want to work on your coding skills first, I can also recommend their bootcamp prep course (either online or in-person). It will provide you some good coding fundamentals that will definitely give you a leg up, wherever you end up (it certainly did for me).",6/1/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
236277,2017.0,True,One of the most academically challenging and physically draining experiences I've experienced.,"I think what many hopeful bootcampers should keep in mind is that most of these boot camps run on some modicum of fear.  If you had some innate drive to become a developer that would push you to learn at ~11 hours a day you have no need for any bootcamp.  It's also good to keep in mind that bootcamps do not have the structure and precision as an accredited school.  All of that being said App Academy is one of the more intense courses.  I did not study hard in college and being tossed into a curriculum that quite literally requires about 10-12 hours of my time daily was extremely difficult, both mentally and physically.  But, the majority of the content is engaging, there is much to learn and it's actually pretty easy to completely be unaware of the passing time.  If you're hoping to pivot careers via bootcamp in 3 months, you should definitely strive for the most accelerated, intense and demanding with a higher level of recognition.  That automatically points to App Academy as one of your choices.",5/30/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,3.7,[],4.0,3.0,4.0,app-academy
236276,2017.0,True,"Challenging, but Worthwhile","App Academy has really been a mental rollercoaster for me. There were days where I truly enjoyed my experience and there were also days where I frantically wanted to get off the ride due to overwhelming stress. However, as with all rollercoasters, the experience is different for everybody. In the end, some people might find that they enjoyed the ride, while others might be happier to get off.  With that being said, App Academy really isn't for everyone, but one thing is certain: you will leave knowing a lot more than when you started.

Before App Academy, I did not have much programming experience besides basic knowledge of SQL from my previous job.  However, within three months, I learned Ruby on Rails, postgreSQL, JavaScript, jQuery, React and Redux and can now make my own full stack applications!  

App Academy isn't a perfect program. The course load is challenging and the pacing is very fast. It's very easy to fall behind if you're not committed--and even if you are committed, it's possible to fall behind if you don't understand the topic before they move forward in the curriculum. However, they have a very dedicated and knowledgeable staff to facilitate the students' learning experiences.

My biggest gripe about the App Academy is how assessment-focused the program is. Their assessments determine your status in the program and due to fear of dismissal, many students solely focus on passing them instead of learning/understanding the material. (If this sounds confusing, it will make a lot more sense if you go through the program). 

With everything being said, I really enjoyed my experience in App Academy, minus the stress and sleep deprivation. I have met some of the most amazing, supportive, and hardworking people in the amazing App Academy community. I would not recommend this program to everyone, but if you're willing to put in the time, energy, sweat, tears, and hard work, App Academy will help you become a software developer!",5/30/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,app-academy

236266,2017.0,True,Intense but rewarding,App Academy is very fast paced with no breaks but you will learn everything you need to know to be a software developer if you are able to keep up.  All of the staff are amazing and great teachers.  App Academy provides you with everything that you need to be sucessful but it is still up to you to actually do the work required.  It is not an easy course but it will take you from knowing nothing about web develpoment to building a fully functional website from scratch in 9 weeks.,5/29/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
236265,2017.0,True,Worth It,"App Academy was a really great experience. It's crazy to think how much I've learned in so little time. I learned more in the first couple weeks here than i did in months of learning on my own. It is very pair-programming focused, which really helps you develop the ability to talk about code and effectively communicate your technical thoughts. The people here are all awesome too.

App Academy really focuses on the skills you need to become a front-end developer. There is not a ton of theory taught, it is more applications based. The skills you will learn here are still very relevant for all of web-development, but just know you will be learning more front-end skills. 

By the end of your time here, you really will be able to build your own applications, and do things you never thought you'd be able to 10 weeks prior. It is not easy, but if you like coding, it is honestly fun. Being able to geek out all day with other people rather than at home struggling to figure things out alone makes this a great experience.

What you get out of App Academy is directly proportional to what you put in.  There are tons of resources for support if you seek them out, but otherwise there is very little forced hand holding or micromanaging.  App Academy is a program for those who truly have a passion for and want to pursue web development, and for those that do, it will hands down return the best results.

236268,2017.0,True,"App Academy is an extremely effective and rewarding software bootcamp, though not for the faint of heart.","I joined App Academy with little to none software experience. What I have come away with is a range of technical knowledge, a strong understanding of the social / collaborative aspects of web development, a work ethic I did not think I could achieve, and, maybe most importantly, a capacity to efficiently learn new technical material. 
The coding portion of the curriculum is difficult, but at the same time structured, well organized, and jam packed with intersting and relevant material. Some of the material is presented in a lecture format, but the bulk of the work is done pair-programming with fellow students. From day 1, this model fosters collaboration and encourages students to solve problems independently, instead of following along with examples. This being said, the instructors are encouraging, readily available, and all-in-all wonderful. Many of the instructors have gone through the bootcamp program as well, so they are knowledgeable in both the technical and social/stress-management aspects of the curriculum. 
While there are weekly assessments, the focus of the program is for you to learn as much as possible, not to transactionally complete assigned projects / homework assignments. In this way, students come away with not only the necessary skills, but also the drive, to start their own projects. Part of the coding curriculum involves completing three large projects, all of which you effectively design and plan yourself (with the support of instructors). These three projects become the focal point of your software portfolio, and are not something that other bootcamp grads can typically claim. Aside from portfolio building, the job-search part of the curriculum is packed with mock-interviews, networking workshops, and time with a personal career coach.  Even post-graduation, App Academy leaves you with technical and networking resources, not to mention close connections to all of the other members of your cohort. 
The bottom line is this: App Academy is a serious time and energy commitment, but leaves you with a range of technical knowledge, an industry ready portfolio, strong technical interviewing skills, and a serious sense of personal pride for having made it through all of that in 13 weeks.",5/29/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
236261,2017.0,True,"Best Coding Bootcamp, But Not for Everyone","This program is a lot of work. A standard day consists of a lecture in the morning, pair programming with new material during the day, and studying for the next day's material at night. There are weekly assessments, which if you fail two, you may be asked to leave the program. As such weekends are spent primarily studying for those assessments. A lot of the curriculum is provided as reading material or videos which you solo study over night. 

This program isn't for everyone and if the above doesn't sound right for you, then this may not be the program for you. 

If the above does sound good and you're willing to put in the time and effort, then App Academy is the best way to become a software developer. The curriculum is up-to-date and relevant for the industry, TAs and fellow students are available for support and assistance, and a/A provides an environment that allows you to focus on learning the material. If I'd tried to learn all of this on my own it would have taken me far more time and there's no way I would have been able to stay this focused on the material.  

Overall attending App Academy was a great decision for myself and I appreciate everything I was able to learn in such a short amount of time.",5/29/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
236257,2017.0,True,App Academy is a top notch structured organization!,"Going into App Academy, I heard good things about it, but I was not sure how it would impact me for the future. 12 weeks later, and I could see why App Academy is one of the best bootcamps in America. They have such a structured curriculum and great organization that feels top notch. From the lectures to content that they provide to the TA's that help out, a/A had something for me whenever I needed help.

So if you any of you have any different opinions about considering this place, I would say try it! I am glad I switched careers and going into development. It's not for the light hearted, and I would recommend that you should only do this if you have a passion for this field.

236255,2017.0,True,A great foundation for programming,"App Academy has given me the foundation of thinking and coding as a software developer that I never thought would be possible. 

I had been trying to figure out how to get into tech without spending another 2 years getting a CS degree, and self-learning was not really going anywhere past simple games because I spent too long getting stuck, not knowing how and where to find help. After doing a little more research, I came across this bootcamp with its deferred tuition model which put me at ease in terms of getting students jobs. That and the stringent month-long admissions process which was already stretching me from a beginner-level (I had done a few projects in MATLAB and C++) and challenging my assumptions gave me an inkling that this might be the right place for me.

Thankfully I was not proven wrong. The pace of the program is extremely fast, but with the benefit of being surrounded by students who are just as motivated as you. And when you get stuck the TAs in the room more than willing to help, which cuts down the learning time significantly of some of the more frustrating concepts (recursion was an early example for me). I did think at times though that there just weren't enough TAs around to help all of us; on some of the more difficult days we were waiting 20 minutes or more.

Overall, I am confident that the fundamentals that App Academy taught me has prepared me well for the job search ahead.

Some advice: 
-Don't be afraid to ask for help! Time is of the essence in a fast-paced course like this and there's no way anyone can 'get' everything that is taught in the 9 weeks as quickly as they would like. Some of the brightest classmates I knew did not hesitate to ask a TA within 10 minutes of being stuck. This is one of the biggest advantages of attending an in-person bootcamp so make use of it!
-Live as close as you can to a/A during the 12 weeks. I consider myself one of the slower classmates when it comes to studying (when I see 30min reading it really means 1hr) and living 10 minutes away has saved me so many times from chopping the resource most essential to a bootcamper: sleep.
-Find some way you can offer value and share it! I find that a large part of my motivation to learn about something really well is to be able to talk about it with someone later on. Our class has a Slack group where people would often share about cool things they implemented/learned and I always appreciated that.

236250,2017.0,True,tldr: It's worth if you're willing to put in the work. The curriculum and TA's are pretty top notch. You will learn a LOT in a short period of time.,"There are many reviews here already, so I'll do a FAQ thing for some of the questions I had when I was applying.

1. Is it really 90 hours per week worth of work?
Yep, at least for many of us. People's experiences here range from never programmed before app academy to having actual software development experience (rare). But I think it's safe to say for the majority of us, it took up all of our time during the week and (for me) weekends.

2. How to succeed?
Work hard. Come study in the office if you can, that way you can ask other people questions. Ask questions from TA's, your smarter cohort-mates, etc.. Ask questions.

3. What are the students' backgrounds?
Most people fall in between professionals looking for a career change, or people straight out of college who decided they didn't want anything to do with their major. Everyone who made it through are extremely hard-working and smart.

4. What do you mean ""made it through""?
You can be dismissed by failing too many assessments. It does put a tremendous amount of stress on the students, however, I feel like I wouldn't have been as motivated as I was without the assessment stress. I do wish they would change the assessment structure to be more project-like though.

5. Can I learn this stuff on my own? Aren't there tons of free material online for this?
Extremely difficult, at least in this short amount of time. The free resources that I used seemed to go from doing for loops to ""hey now go make a project"". It's very easy to run into a bug or a question that you can't figure out when learning on your own. It's also very easy to give up. You won't have TA's to ask questions or give you feedback. When I was trying to learn this on my own, it was like running through a wall. At least at a/A, you got like 60 other people running through the same wall with you and the TA's to help.",5/28/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

236166,2017.0,True,App Academy Delivers,"When I started looking at different boot camps I was already taking online open courseware classes. There were three main things I was looking for that I could not get self-teaching. The first was coding with other people - App Academy focuses heavily on pairing and you will pair for the majority of the day every single day for the first seven weeks. The second factor was having people actually look at and critique my code, as online code checkers really tell you nothing about code quality, only code correctness at best. This was addressed with pairing, TA code reviews, lectures on best practices, and studying the provided daily solutions. Lastly, I knew that I would seriously need help in the job search. This was the real kicker, as App Academy's tuition model of paying a percentage of your first year's salary really gave me confidence that I would be supported and pushed throughout the job search process. I'm happy to say that really was exactly my experience. On my own, I never would have pushed myself to apply so quickly and to so many places, but with App Academy's support I ended up nabbing a Software Engineer position I am super excited about in almost exactly three months after starting to apply, which is the average time. The stats are real! (Salary stats, too)

Overall I was very impressed with the structure of the program, so much is really thought through in advance. The admission process mirrors job search, and the tests serve not only to ensure you keep up with the pace but also are great preparation for timed coding challenges in interviews. I would definitely suggest studying a lot in advance and making sure you are strong in your fundamentals. The provided a/A material is really the bare minimum, I took CS50x and MIT 6.001x and would highly recommend them. If you are not prepared for the first weeks it is nearly impossible to catch up and I would say most people who fail out do so because they were not sufficiently prepared. Also, if you have sufficient time, I would recommend spending some time to learn algorithms in advance as you will have a ton of things on your plate during job search.",5/23/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
236133,2016.0,True,App Academy = Entirely worth it,"Truthfully, App Academy was one of the best decisions I personally have ever made - I feel very lucky to have attended. I am writing this days after having just accepted a job offer - the program really helped launch me and get me to this point, without a doubt. I attended a San Francisco cohort in 2016; I chose the program because I got the gut feeling it would be quite challenging and super high-quality, and this proved to be true. It is very hard work, and requires continuous persistence. Simultaneously, though, it was some of the most fun I ever had - you not only create a network, but more importantly you are simply taking a plunge into something new with a lot of bright people who are also starting this journey with you. I don't think I met one person who was really ""cutthroat"", everyone is eager and willing to help one another; this says a lot about a/A's screening process. 
If you are reading this, a big concern you may need addressed is the tuition model and if this is ""too good to be true"". It is not. I paid my $5000 deposit, then App Academy invested a ton of time, energy, and resources into me until I found my job, several months after the program ended. They mean it when they say they are invested in you for the long haul. I feel like they believed in me and stuck with me, honestly. They were more than willing to work with me on my re-payment structure, because frankly after several months of searching your finances inevitably dwindle. BOTTOM-LINE: App Academy just doesn't want to get screwed, and you don't want to screw App Academy. They are a business and need to get paid, but they have mercy and understand your situation.

236060,2017.0,True,The Amount You Learn Will Surprise You,"The amount of material App Academy requires students to learn within 3 months is tremendous. If students don't keep up every day and manage time well, it is difficult to keep up. To put it into perspective, I took two quarters of C in college and the material I learned was roughly equivalent to the 1 month prepwork that is required after you get in before you actually start the course.

Pros: 
- The material is well thought out and the curriculum is solid. 
- You are surrounded daily by peers just as driven as you.
- Great staff and instructors. (Just as in any educational setting you'll find some spectacular instructors vs good instructors)
- Able to learn materials needed to get a job within a succinct amount of time

Cons:
-The curriculum pacing in the beginning is a bit slow and suddenly week it speeds up quickly after week 4 making it difficult to catch up at times
- You are required every day from 9 - 6pm and with the homework is usually a 12 hour work day. This could be considered a pro if you don't have other commitments such as family, or spend two hours commuting daily as I did.
- No longer a 12 week bootcamp but a mandatory 13 week course

Overall, App Academy is a solid program, and the instructors are committed in seeing you succeed. They have a solid business model which makes them even more motivated to help the students.

236041,2017.0,True,Absolutely loved this program,"A fantastic way to break into learning how to code. I had a great experience in this program. You aren't simply fed material to memorize to pass a test or interview. The curriculum and classroom environment are very much centered around making sure you understand the material. 

One of the best things about the bootcamp was the instructors. The instructors were clearly knowledgable and passionate about programming. Also lectures were engaging, which is very important when trying to learn some of the more complicated material. The course not only provides a massive amount of practice problems, but also many resources to study to continue learning long after you have graduated.

Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. I grew very much as a person and as a student programmer. I am also proud to say that this program assisted me in being accepted into App Academy!

I especially liked how the instructor taught methodically and in a  manner that helped the students understand where common errors in programming might occur. This allowed me to feel more confident in my abilities- especially my ability to debug my programs.

I think the curriculum is structured very well, so you are learning new concepts step by step. Every day you are paired with different students for building new projects. Pair programming helps you to get a sense of working environment and get feedback on how you're doing.

I would recommend being overprepared during each and every step of App Academy - prep work, curriculum, assessments, algorithms, job search - overkill everything.

Those with zero coding experience will really benefit from attending the bootcamp prep, especially if the idea of teaching yourself seems daunting or there is a time constraint. The material is challenging and fast paced but the instructors guide you every step of the way. The instructors are your best asset and are always willing to help you, should you ask. Be prepared to dedicate a portion of your hours outside of the class to studying, otherwise you are not taking full advantage of the course. People who attend the prep course come from all different walks of life, whether it's a career change or because they prefer the fast paced learning as opposed to attending college.

244566,2016.0,True,App Academy Works. But There Are Other Options.,"App Academy was definitely a life changing experience. And I'm glad it was my first real exposure to code. But honestly having gone through several Udacity courses and Flatiron's immersive, it was the least helpful in me acquiring my position. 

The curriculum seemed oversimplified in comparison to the learning platforms I approached (including the other boot camp). But in all fairness. App academy will work for you if you've really struggled with programming before. The resources are all there to help you succeed. As long as you use them. 

My only complaint is with job placement. Although you do get an opportunity to attend the job fair, if you're not perfectly prepared to deal with the pressures of technical interviewing right away, it seems like nobody believes in you afterwards.

My turn-around point for me was after the 3rd week. That was when I realized keeping a schedule is a MUST. If possible, put your personal life on hold and put aA as your #1 priority. The amount of material to be learned demands such a schedule. As far as the subjects covered, they are some of the most marketable programming skills nowadays. I learned Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and etc (just to name a few).

235549,2016.0,True,The best bootcamp,"I come from a background working as a QA Engineer in the kind of start-up I believe App Academy prepares you to develop for. The day-to-day curriculum is set up in such a way that students who are brand new to the material have a manageable and well thought out roadmap, and people who are familiar with the concepts can explore more in depth material after finishing their daily tasks. In this way I believe that the curriculum is beautifully geared towards giving students the full reward of their hard work and providing people who have a good work ethic and genuine interest in technology all of the tools they need to succeed.

 

The career counseling is also extremely valuable for prospective job seekers. The amount of emphasis put on knowing the material well enough to have conversations about it, as well as interviewing techniques to set you apart from other bootcampers, is critical to opening up opportunities for jobs that are denied graduates of other bootcamps. I have seen graduates from coder-mills come out of their bootcamps and spend 2-3x longer than the average App Academy graduate before finding employment, due to the fact that they were not set up for success.

 

In summary, I'd recommend App Academy for people who are not only capable of working hard, but are extremely passionate about software engineering/app development. It is an unbelievably intensive curriculum where doing the minimum should not be enough to satisfy you, because you don't attend this bootcamp with the expectation of getting a degree or good grades, you do it out of a love and passion for the trade you're training for.",3/29/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

The daily flow involves pair programming, working on one- or two-day projects, starting off with console games and moving into web-based applications. The full-stack capstone project really pushes you to synthesize everything you have learned and present it in a visually appealing way. There is a good spirit of camaraderie among the students and the TA's are ready to help and share their experience.

I constantly found myself stuck in my programming journey because I would feel like my knowledge was never complete on any one thing. App academy's fast pace forces you through the lesser topics while still making sure you know enough to move on.

* Location is great in SF with a nice view
* Learn multiple languages and technologies

Cons:
* Not much freedom in the curriculum - assignments are same for everyone

235468,2017.0,True,a/A is alright,"App Academy was crucial to me getting my start. I'd been exploring coding for awhile but App Academy put the fire under me to really get moving. Yes, the pace is fast. Yes, it is possible to fall behind. Yes, it is very stressful and difficult. However, I found that it push me forward when otherwise I would have lingered. There were plenty of topics that I wish I could have spent more time on, but I became a capable engineer within a few months and you can go back and solidify those sections whenever. Mostly, what sold me was the pricing structure. They are invested in you, which helped with my own confidence level and meant they would really help me find a job. 4/5 because I would have liked to see more daily projects to completion rather than switching contexts, as well as a broader introduction to all the materials in the prepwork given how fast we breezed by them in the curriculum.",3/27/2017,Bootcamp Prep,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,app-academy
235506,2017.0,True,Definitely worth it.,"App Academy has been a wild ride, and I only just finished Week 9. I know the purpose of App Academy was to find a job, but I felt like I got so much more. While I am shooting for a job, and I do believe I won’t have any issues finding one, I felt that the experiences and knowledge I’ve gained from the previous “9” weeks at App Academy have been so much more valuable. There’s quotations there because there was significant prep work before starting the program.

The past nine weeks have absolutely flown by. I’ve learned Ruby on Rails, jQuery, SQL, HTML, CSS, React.js, Redux and so much more. I’ve gotten the opportunity to build a full-stack, single-page web application from scratch with as little or as much guidance as I needed, and this, in and of itself was the best part of the program.

I would highly recommend App Academy to everyone who wants to start with a new and rewarding career. And I’ll highly recommend App Academy even more when I get a job.

Pros:
+ You learn more about programming and web apps than you would at your own pace
+ Strong community of motivated students
+ Intense and fast-paced so you learn a lot in a short amount of time

Things to consider before joining:

235495,2017.0,True,Best education money can't buy,"Believe the hype.  I had read up a LOT on App Academy and other boot camps and ended up putting all my eggs in on basket - App Academy - it was the right basket!

I figured that out at the end of the day 1.  They really had their act together right off the bat.  From there, I would just continue to be impressed at how well designed and executed the curriculum delivery was.  It comes at you fast and furious and you pretty much have no life, but the immersion (plus very well timed concept reinforcements) starts to pay dividends quickly.  

You are moving at a very fast clip from topic to topic, first doing mostly pair programming single-day projects that focus on one or two competencies at a time, but then you're doing more comprehensive multi-day projects where if you haven't been keeping up, you're spending a lot of time in your Evernote or on Stack Overflow.  Finally, you're on your own doing full stack and it's then you realize just how much you've learned.  No more training wheels.

Ultimately you're exposed to just about the whole breadth of the field, enough to know where to start when you want to go deep and leverage a different technology.  You know how to team problem solve, pair program, and along the way get a firm grasp on algorithms, data structures, databases, and different architectural frameworks to tackle whatever comes next.

The TA's are very helpful and they are constantly available to answer your questions during the daily assignments.

There are some things to be wary about, though. If you fall behind, you will be playing catch up and be stressed for the rest of the curriculum. For that reason, I suggest people who are looking to attend to prepare by making going through free online classes on Ruby, Javascript, and some basic SQL. Know about object oriented programming.

235385,2016.0,True,An amazing and rewarding program for those who work at it.,"I have been impressed with App Academy since the moment I applied through every step of the curriculum. 

The screening process was rigorous but humane, and they treat you like a valued individual (as opposed to another equivalent school that I got into where the interviewer was taking a Lyft or something while he was conducting my interview). 

The curriculum itself is really really well designed, not only building on itself to facilitate learning and deep comprehension, but is constantly being updated to incorporate the most highly demanded and up to date technologies. In my cohort they trained us to be strong React and ES6 developers, while not neglecting the older technologies, like jQuery. This turned out to be invaluable in the job hunt, since a lot of companies were looking for React developers when we graduated. 

I was skeptical at first about their emphasis of Ruby on Rails, since most companies seem to be moving away from that, but in retrospect, it really is the best way to learn about how a full stack application works, especially for people with less experience. And they do their best to give you a deep understanding of why things work the way they do so that those skills are transferrable. 

The program also gives you a good foundation in algorithms, web and backend architecture, and interviewing skills. I was just amazed at the amount of knowledge I had gained after the 13 week program. I received 5 job offers within 3 weeks of graduating, one of which I ended up accepting, and I'm very excited to be formally starting my software engineering career. 

However...there are a few caveats.

First, new students should know that you don’t magically get all these skills just because you get into the program. I found myself frustrated by a few of my peers who seemed more focused on socializing and just getting by in the assessments than studying and finishing all the projects and assignments. Because a lot of the learning happens in pairs, a weaker partner will compromise the learning opportunities of others. It also risks the reputation of the program as a whole. However, this was more the exception than the rule. Most students worked hard, demonstrated a real passion for programming, and took what a/A taught as a foundation for more self-directed learning, and in doing so became good developers that can build almost anything. 

Second, just being a strong developer doesn’t guarantee you a job interview. Especially in a market weary of bootcampers. That part relies on a lot of networking and luck and doing extra side projects. So the job search is a demoralizing, grueling process to get your foot in the door. Once you get your technical or onsite, though, you’ll find that App Academy has prepared you well.  

Pros: 
- well-designed curriculum that builds incrementally on learning
- teaches the most up-to-date technologies/libraries/frameworks
- good balance of lectures, hands-on projects, videos, take-home assignments
- reasonable hours for a bootcamp (9am-6pm, + 2-3 hours of homework) 
- gives a good foundation in algorithms, web architecture, and other skills necessary for interviews
- based on pair programming and collaborative skills
- good job search guidance for how to craft your resume, frame your past experiences, etc. 
- deferred tuition model reflects how much the program is invested in making you a good, employable developer
- progressive values and mindset, encourages diversity and inclusiveness for all backgrounds

Cons: 
- bootcamps in general have a bad rap these days, so it seems to be a more challenging than before for grads get interviews 
- less rigorous screening and assessments process for students may hurt reputation in the long run
- didn’t feel particularly close to my cohort or staff, but like I mentioned, that was less of a priority for me
- growing student numbers might compromise quality of training in the future 
- some TA’s are less knowledgeable than others, but you’ll always get the help and guidance you need
- there’s now more structure and support during the job search process than previous cohorts, but it’s still not enough
- paying back a large percentage of salary can end up being more than other schools’ tuition if you end up getting a really good offer. (#firstworldproblems)",3/22/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
235354,2016.0,True,Results speak for themselves,"Pros:
* The results. They have a very high placement rate, and I was hired into one of the best companies in the world after graduating. 
* Deferred tuition model. I didn't trust any bootcamp to give me a worthwhile education except for App Academy since you only pay when you get hired.
* Job hunting support. Since they only get paid when you get hired, they are very invested in helping you get a job. 
* The people are great. Both students and teachers are wonderful people, and I made several awesome friends.
* Teachers are very helpful, most of them know a ton. 
* You will learn a lot of useful information relevant to an actual web development job. 

Cons:
* Some teachers are fresh graduates of the program so in some cases they will have to defer to a more senior member. Not a big deal, just wastes a little time. 
* It is a lot of work. If you make it in and you are able to keep up (try not to fall more than a day behind), then you will learn a lot but you can't slack off. During the week I had zero free time, but on most weekends I had some free time. I would rather have it at this pace than be less work spread over more time. 
* Pressure. Since you can get kicked out for poor performance (not hard to do if you fall behind more than a couple days), there is quite a bit of stress and pressure involved. It eases up later in the program as the chances of getting kicked out diminish significantly.
* Inconsistencies in curriculum. Since their curriculum is constantly evolving and being worked on by multiple people, some parts of it are out of date, some are redundant, and some are incorrect.

233633,2015.0,True,The best way to make a career change!,"I am now celebrating my one year anniversary as a software developer and this would not have been possible without App Academy.  After four years in a field that was not everything I expected it to be, I decided that I wanted to make a change; and I assume since you are reading this review, you are thinking the same thing.  Once I decided that I was invested in making this transition, and a bootcamp was the best way for me to make the change, I began to compare various programs and the main thing that differed App Academy from the others was their payment plan.   Due to the time requirements for all these programs (80+ hours a week) it is pretty unrealistic to expect to keep any resemblance of a job/income and living in NYC without one is pretty tough to do.  App Academy helps remedy this by not requiring any payment (other than a security deposit) until you land that first job.  Not only did this make living in an expensive city with no job more do-able but also gives them a ""horse in the race” when you start your job hunt.  This includes continuous interview prep of white boarding, alumni Q&A, review/critique of your portfolio (resume, cover letter, GitHub/coding projects, personal website, and LinkedIn profile) as well as an in-house job fair at the end of your cohort.

Regarding the curriculum I found that while interviewing, most companies are not looking for you to know a certain stack but have the ability to learn a new stack (if needed) based on what you already know.  Most bootcamps offer a full stack curriculum in order to give you the needed marketable skills to prove you confidently know what you should and that you can learn something new if needed, and App Academy is no different. When I attended, the stack was Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, Backbone.js, jQuery, HTML, and CSS and since then they have updated to React.js instead of Backbone.js, but don’t worry, all new material is available to you as alumni so that you can use it if you would like to learn a new framework.  Like anything you do, you will get what you put in and App Academy gives you everything you need in order to succeed and become qualified in all the topics you cover.  From day one you will need to properly prepare for the interview process where you will complete online exams, a live coding challenge, and a live interview; and the testing doesn't end there.  To make sure that everyone is where they need to be so that no student is disadvantaged while pair programming there are (bi)-weekly exams that you must pass in order to continue with the program.  Preparing for this will include hours of studying and practice on the weekends and after class… this will definitely be 80+ hours a week.  All of this is not to discourage you because if you really expect to become proficient in so many languages in such a short amount of time, this is the only way to do it.  If you are ready to put in the time for 4 months and 100% sold on becoming a developer I think that App Academy will be perfect for you.

TL:DR - App Academy offers a comparable stack/curriculum to other bootcamps with everything you need to succeed if you are really 100% committed to the program.  It WILL be 80+ hours a week to get by and pass their weekly progress exams and 100+ if you want to really excel at everything.  That being said, I would not be at my current company without it and the payment plan they offer allowed me to even think this transition would be possible.",2/4/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

I was given the tools to modularize my own concepts into building blocks for industry-standard apps. I studied proven algorithms and formulated many of my own algorithms for problems that arose in real time. The staff was extremely knowledgable and savvy, and the lectures were always engaging. I also enjoyed the fact that so much emphasis was placed on teamwork. Most of the projects are done in pairs, which forces students to adapt to different personalities and working styles. Finally, the Fullstack project was a great way to put all the skills we learned to the test. I felt so accomplished when I finally got my MVP's working and my app bug-free and deployed to a fresh custom domain. The reason the course exists, though, is job placement.

aA itself is an amazing institution. It's pay after model makes it affordable for students like me who did not have thousands of dollars up front, but more importantly, it gives aA a vested interest in finding you not only a job upon graduation, but a high paying job. This model is vastly superior to traditional university systems, which seem to only care about billing students after graduation.

234645,2016.0,True,difficult but very worth it,"Before: 

When I was first considering joining a coding boot camp I was fairly skeptical.  3 months to change careers and make the kind of money a/A advertised seemed too good to be true. Especially since going in I had no college degree and no related professional experience.   I did a lot of research and applied to many of the major boot camps offering 'similar' curriculums.  I was accepted to a few including Dev Bootcamp and Flatiron School.  

All of the boot camps say that their curriculum is geared towards people with ""no experience"", so anyone can do it.  That's a bit misleading as they all will expect you to demonstrate some logical competency and a basic understanding of how to problem solve programmatically in the interview.  I spent about 6 months practicing on sites like codeschool.com and codewars.com before I began applying.  In the end, I selected a/A for two reasons:  their tuition structure (pay after you get a job), and because I found their application process to be the most difficult.  I applied 3 times before I was accepted to a/A, vs. my first try at the other schools.

During:

My brother is a Marine and had a great time ribbing me about going to a 'boot camp' for obvious reasons.  But I have to say, although there are not pushups, calling it a boot camp isn't far off.  It is very, very hard, and the hours are long.  Again, I never graduated college, so my basis for comparison might be skewed, but even people in my cohort with degrees ranging from BAs to PhDs acknowledged that it was a difficult program.  The style of teaching at a/A is to show you a thing once, then give you instructions and a day to replicate it with a partner, with the TAs on hand to assist.  They will not give you direct answers (for the most part) but rather guide you through the all-important process of debugging and figuring out problems on your own.  It's challenging, and at times very frustrating, but ultimately the system teaches you how to be a self-reliant developer.

After:

In 5 months I went from being a bartender with no college degree to a well-paid full-stack (actual job title, not just a buzz word) web developer at a company that I'm very excited about.  Most graduates (so far, from my class) landed an initial salary between 90 and 100k.  Another concern I had going in was that a/A teaches Ruby on Rails, which some developers will tell you isn't the most relevant language these days.  That's BS.  Developers love to be opinionated about the tech that they work with, and you will be too eventually.  I love Rails, but I can say objectively that it's more about learning how a server is structured than the specific syntax you are using.  The knowledge that I got from a/A felt tech agnostic by the time I reached the job hunt; language is a nonissue.  Anyways, there are definitely a lot of Rails specific developer positions out there if that's the route you decide to go.  The job hunt is a bit intense, but there are designated a/A staff members to help you along the way.  If you follow their road map, keep studying after graduation, and utilize your peer support network, you will find a job in under 3 months. 

 

Tl;dr

It's hard to get in, very hard to keep up, and reasonably difficult to find a job afterward.  But if you are expecting any part of it to be easy it's not for you.

234605,2014.0,True,Greatest decision of my life,"I was stuck in a dead-end job, feeling unfulfilled, unable to find different work, ready for a challenge. I had played around with programming on my own, and found it to be entrancing. The thought of building something and collaborating with others to make something cool and new captured my imagination.

However, I didn't have $15,000 lying around.

App Academy, as it does with all of it's students, took a chance on me.

After completing the rigorous pre-work, surviving through the nerve-wracking Skype interviews, and blowing through the online tests, I was accepted into this illustrious bootcamp whose unique payment method and renown had separated them from the pack. The deal was that I wouldn't pay a penny until they had helped me acquire a high-paying development job in Manhattan.

I don't believe they allow this anymore, but when the program started, I had resolved to quite literally live at App Academy. That meant waking up at 8am, reviewing code, sitting through the 9am lecture, pair programming all day, writing my daily reflections, doing my homework, doing my readings, and sleeping under my terminal. This went on for 4 months.

Fast-forward to the final project, I was smashing through code on a different intellectual level than I could've imagined at the outset of the program. Unable to stop writing software to prove that I could do this on my own.

Fast-forward to the job search curriculum, I had a few weeks where I was talking to 3 different companies at once, and achieved a total of 6 offers, all at least 20k more than I was making at my previous job just 5 months prior.

and now fast forward two years since graduating, I'm a Senior Software Engineer working at a cutting edge company doing work I love making triple my salary before a/A.

My options are endless now, I can continue living in NYC, rising the ladder, maybe becoming a CTO one day, I could switch it up and freelance remotely while traveling the world, or I could even try to take a risk on founding a startup, and it's all thanks to my decision to go to App Academy.",1/11/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

Unlike some of the boot camps springing up that seem to springing up to capture some quick profit, App Academy is building something awesome. With its highly selective admissions process and no-tuition business model, App Academy is bringing innovation to the badly broken higher education system. 

During my time at a/A, I was surrounded by some of the the smartest, most driven people I have ever known. This environment lent itself to some seriously accelerated learning: a few months before I applied, I didn't know the first thing about computer programming, and especially not about the arcana of web development. But by graduation day, I had landed a job at an awesome startup and have been impressing my superiors since (which is apparently normal for App Academy grads). 

Some people took quite a bit longer to find jobs, but I don't know anywhere from my cohort who has not yet found a good web dev job. And if you have even an iota of charisma (I think I do) or have a strong STEM background (I don't), you can expect to find a job in no time.

So basically if you want to learn a ton from smart people with other smart people and then get paid money to keep doing that when you finish, do a/A.

234339,2016.0,True,Tough but works,"App Academy is super tough -- but also super effective. I graduated in April 2016 and landed my first dev job in under a month. 

The pros: This course really goes in-depth. I had taken a lot of classes before (introductory classes to one language or another, some online tutorials to front-end, etc) but anything that dove into the real nuts and bolts of how websites and apps goes together left me with more questions than answers. App Academy forces you to dig into the subject matter and come out with the tools to move forward. You'll be surrounded by people as passionate about learning as you are, and the TAs are always on-hand to get you past whatever is blocking your understanding. If you can graduate from a/A, you can get a job in development (and succeed in it!)

The cons:  This course is not a fun time. App Academy is grueling and, frankly, pretty miserable most of the time. If doing all code every day sounds like a negative, this might not be the course for you. If you aren't excited enough about code to put your life on hold for 12 weeks, you should probably look for a different bootcamp. Most people have to put in a lot of hours to keep up with the curriculum, and if you fall behind -- you're out. 

That being said: if you aren't discouraged by the workload -- go for it. The curriculum is rock-solid, the instructors are committed to helping you succeed, and the statistics are there to prove it. The fact that I only had to pay after getting hired made this bootcamp affordable for me when others weren't, and the job-hunting portion of the curriculum is thorough and effective. If you're looking to change your career path and can take 12 weeks to do nothing but write code (and I do mean nothing), this is a sure bet.",1/10/2017,Bootcamp Prep,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

a/A give you the tools you need to launch a career in tech. The curriculum is rigorous. Indeed, you will need to commit ~80 hours per week to be successful in this program. Your instructors and classmates provide the motivation to survive the long work days. Pair programming FTW!

My degree is in Premedical Nutrition Science. I knew nothing about programming when I first applied to a/A. Only one month after graduation, I received my first job offer! Everyone from my cohort was employed within 2 months.

There's also a wonderful network of a/A grads. Many have become very successful in the field, working for big name companies like Google and Facebook. Referrals are aplenty.

But don't take it from me - I think the business model says it all. You don't pay tuition until you get a job, and the amount you owe is based on how much you earn.

It works so well in so little time because 1) the market is on fire, 2) the curriculum is compact with zero fat, 3) you breathe web development with smart peers for the duration of the program. These skills are in high demand, and app academy does an amazing job of drilling this stuff in your head in a way that gets you ready to enter the workforce with a high degree of aptitude. The acceptance bar is pretty high, but you kind of want that because it ensures that the people you are learning this stuff with are as sharp and hungry as you are.

I was initially won over by App Academy’s deferred tuition model because it aligned the school’s interests of getting paid with my interests of getting a coding job post-bootcamp.

But the tuition model only works because App Academy actually delivers on their ambitious sales pitch. As a former high school math teacher, I was most impressed by App Academy’s curriculum and instruction. As someone who was definitely on the less experienced end of the spectrum (I had worked in an operations role at a tech startup prior, but never as a developer), App Academy continuously pushed me just outside of my intellectual comfort zone for 12 weeks straight. What’s more, App Academy’s flipped classroom approach, emphasis on building projects and pair programming ensured that I was really internalizing and absorbing the enormous amount of material. The weekly assessments were definitely stressful to say the least, but looking back, I’m thankful because I know the material that much better. In addition, NYC staff members are not only super knowledgeable and passionate about technology themselves, but they’re also genuinely nice people who really put student learning first and foremost (regardless of how novice the question). The real game-changer is your fellow students: these are some of the smartest people I’ve ever collaborated with, and we really supported each other throughout to understand the material.

I’m not going to lie and say that it was a breeze — it was probably the hardest three-months of work. But after three months of insanity, I’m now a web developer — which is crazy and a testament to what someone passionate about software development can accomplish at App Academy.",1/9/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

I found both modules surprisingly thorough and deep as well. I was well prepared for my first job as a developer and felt like the course gave me the tools I needed to hit the ground running.

I was offered a software engineer job on the last official day of the course. I've been at the job 3 months now and am very happy with my role and feel like the course prepared me well.

The course is very intensive, but really not as grueling as it is hyped up to be. The real hard part is getting in, so make sure you are well prepared before applying. I also highly recommend their Jump Start program if it is offered to you.

Their job search support is just simple high school resume and interview advice. Not very useful for most, but if you've never applied for a job before it's better than nothing, I suppose. The true resource is your classmates; a pool of 70 or so brilliant and highly motivated people to practice interview problems with.

I liked the curriculum albeit it isn't perfect, could use a slight change in pace and emphasis in certain sections. However it is very up-to-date and relevant; I feel well-prepared for when I start at PayPal.

However, the work was a lot more challenging than expected and definitely extremely comprehensive. We learned so much during the 3 months, I was extremely surprised at what I could accomplish by the end. 

It definitely was a lot of hard work. Students spend upwards of 80 to 100 hours a week to keep up. This is not an exaggeration. People do get expelled from the program if they cannot keep up. However, the exams are extremely fair and as long as you keep up, you will do fine. 

I ended up getting multiple offers within a month after graduating and nearly doubled my salary from my last job. I am not working in the field I love.",1/3/2017,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
234940,2016.0,True,Amazing Experience!,"You are expected to learn quite a bit about Ruby on your own before you are accepted into App Academy. Once in, you WILL be spending a lot of time learning and coding. A typical class day starts at 9am and ends at 6pm, but students will stay until 10-11 to finish the day's project or start on the next day's material. Expect this schedule for the next 4 months or so of your life.

The curriculum is constantly evolving to cater to the needs of the current job market. At the time I'm writing this, React/Redux is one of the hottest frameworks in the market, so the tail end of the curriculum is devoted to React. However, should another language/framework take over, the instruction team will configure the curriculum accordingly.

You will spend most of your day pair-programming with another student on the day's projects, switching every 15 minutes between typing and navigating (giving instructions on what to code next). The teaching assistants are available for help if the two of you get stuck on something. From experience, they are almost always able to pinpoint where you got stuck and explain why you made the errors you made.

The instruction team generally consists of graduates from previous cohorts, who, having gone through the same material, are constantly finding the best way to explain and present the curriculum.

The job assistance team regularly brings alums and industry insiders to discuss their experience with the program, and helps connect current students with alums at their firms. They will also help you with your communications to negotiate and maximize your earning potential, since a higher salary for you means a higher payment to them.",12/16/2016,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
233118,2016.0,True,Couldn't be happier with my decision,"Recent AppAcademy graduate (August NYC cohort) and I can honestly say that I am incredibly happy that I made the decision to join. After completing my MS in Applied Physics and working as a Process Engineer (no software engineering background), I felt as though I needed to make a career change. After applying to jobs for about 5 months, I began looking into some alternatives and eventually found the coding bootcamp option. I was very hesitant at first because it is a huge time and $ investment and it almost felt as though I was giving up on my current credentials and qualifications. 

But once I started, those feelings of hesitation quickly disappeared and now that I have completed the program and received multiple offers from great companies within weeks of graduating, I can safely say that I am more excited than ever to start my new career as a software engineer. Not only do I have a passion to continue learning and excelling in this field, but I am confident in what I will bring to my next job. 

All in all, I highly recommend this program to anyone who wants to accelerate their path to becoming a software engineer and is willing to put in the effort (some in my class were able to get away with 60hr/weeks, but I probably came closer to 80hr/weeks). All of the resources to succeed are in place and the deferred tuition model demonstrates the belief that AppAcademy places in it's curriculum, instructors, and most importantly, students.",12/3/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

-Completed the program in late July 2016
-Job hunted for ~1.5 months (I underestimated how difficult this would be, not only from an X's and O's execution perspective, but also from a psychological perspective going from employed to not-employed, etc.)
-Received multiple offers
-I've both spoken with grads from other bootcamps conversationally, as well interviewed them formally. In both cases, it's amazing how much App Academy teaches you compared to other bootcamps. It comes as no surprise their graduates command the highest salaries fresh out of school.
-Quality control is serious business at App Academy. Dismissal of students based on performance and/or attendance is a real thing. That being said, keep in mind that dismissing students for performance is against App Academy's financial interest (they'll refund your $$ and not charge you). As such, know that assessments are not there to ""trick you,"" and leverage the resources they offer accordingly.  Deal with it, and learn to love it. It's the only way they can maintain the brand mentioned in the previous bullet point.

The amount you'll learn at App Academy truly is incredible, and your classmates will be your network in tech as the job offers start rolling in. In most cases, you always have the option of going back to your previous career if you don't like what you see, and you'll receive a free education along the way. In that way, App Academy was one of the lowest-risk, highest-reward investments I've ever made in myself. Just.... do it!

235130,2016.0,True,You drink from the firehose and you get what you put into it,"THE GOODS:
I joined a/A because I wanted to make a switch to a dev career, coming from 3 years in Marketing, but with some programming experience. Still, there are some pretty brilliant students in my cohort with varied backgrounds, sometimes with 0 coding experience, and they're doing very well. Which, in summary, means: no matter your background, a/A will give you the tools to be successful, but it will be up to you and how well you adapt to the intense curriculum.

This is not the regular college pace. It's much more intensive than that. If you fail 2 of the weekly assessments, you're out. Some of the people from my cohort who got kicked out weren't putting enough effort into it and were still in the college inertia, which isn't enough. Again: you get what you put into it.

You will get support from TAs on the floor every day. A lot of the times, they will not directly answer your questions but guide you to the answer by showing you the pieces, making you think it through. I really liked this approach as it made me realize that I had the answer most of the times, but was looking at it through the wrong perspective.

When I joined, I expected to learn the basis that would allowed me to learn a lot more of the things I wanted, but it ended up exceeding my expectations. They not only teach you how to develop a full-stack webapp and the technologies behind one, but they go through a lot of CS concepts too, which was beyond what I expected.

The tech curriculum is proprietary, very well written and structured. It explains a lot of things in details, which means you can expect countless hours of lectures and readings.

You will walk out with a lot of small projects that you'll develop throughout the curriculum, plus three bigger ones for your résumé. Most importantly: you'll finish wanting to do more, so you'll most likely develop some projects on your own afterwards.

Their system for tracking progress is really impressive and well designed, which makes you feel more confident in the structure they offer.

THE BADS:
The job search curriculum is less structured than the tech one. The content is there, but it's not centralized, so you often have to remember where to go if you want to check presos, homework material or schedule. 

There are few job search coaches for the full cohort, so it gets a bit hard to get some good feedback from them.

1) It is the top bootcamp and you get to work with smart people. Pair programming is common across many high quality bootcamp. Some people doubt the value of it. But when you work with programmers who are better than you, you will become a better programmer. At a/A, some students have CS background and some are just bright students who can digest concepts quickly. I was able to discuss different ways of solving problems and learned a lot from my peers. You will miss your days of pair programming when you are in project phase.

2) It focuses on job preparation. While other bootcamps focus on projects exclusively during the second half of the program, a/A makes you learn algorithms and prepare for interviews. IMO, you can always fix your projects on weekends or after the program. But having career support is the key to getting a job. Also, sharing interview tips with other students who are going through the same process gives you a unique advantage.

The number of TA was not enough for my cohort. It didn't cause any problem until the project phase. But they realized the problem and hired more TA for the next cohort.

The program is very structured for the first 9 weeks, and everything is fully laid out for you - you know exactly what you're supposed to do every day of every week, and how long it's expected to take. The structure was really helpful for me so I knew whether or not I was falling behind, and I knew what was expected of me. There are assessments to test your knowledge, which are probably the most stressful part of the program, but you'll be fine if you study the material and do the practice tests. App Academy doesn't want you to fail, they do what they can to let you know what type of material they're going to test on.

In all, it's incredible to look back on my experience and remember how little I knew before I started and how far I've come since then.

235102,2016.0,True,Simple and tough,"Background: A former teacher/political science graduate who decided to become a programmer last year.

Application: I applied to App Academy in December 2015, and started attending in August of 2016. I was invited to do the Jumpstart program, which is a two week instensive where they try to help you get into the program, while teaching you fundamentals of programming (Jumpstart has its own mini curriculum). 

Thoughts on the program: App Academy doesn't have a lot of flair, the facilities are fairly bair bone, which for me is a plus. Attending a bootcamp with a beer tap, or 7 ply toilet paper, means that someone (you) has to pay for it. 

The instructional staff are all former students who aced the course (there are 6 assessments) and were rated well by their peers. This means they tend to be very helpful, but they aren't perfect. That overall adds positively to the ambiance, since working with someone who may not know exactly how to solve your problems means you can follow their debugging process while they solve your problem.

Overall, the program is really intense. I haven't spoken with most of my friends for over an hour during the course of the program, and I have killed all of my hobbies. I was not a programmer before, and this meant I had to push myself much harder than those who had backgrounds which lends them more to programming. The program is not perfect, but honestly, what is? The program is free, except for the 5,000 debosit you need to pay upfront. There is a strike system, and an assessment system so it is possible to fail out(semi-common) or strike out(extremely uncommon-unless you suck as a human).

If you can push yourself this hard, and you enjoy programming, then this is the program for you. It's no frills, the people and instructors are awesome, and overall it is enjoyable, if a bit intense.",11/18/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy

App Academy focuses on pair programming every day, which is a great way to learn what your weaknesses are, to learn through teaching, and sharpen your interpersonal skills (what future employers care about!). The course also slowly progresses from from holding your hand to a hands off approach so that you learn to teach yourself anything you want or need to know, another necessary skill in the workplace. Speaking of the workplace, App Academy's job search curriculum is incredibly involved. They really help you polish your resume, cover letter, and interviewing skills.

Most of what I learned was through Ruby on Rails tutorials and some personal Rails applications, all self-taught. App Academy had a perfect mix of CS theory and practical development to enrich my understanding of building software. This mix also provided an excellent foundation for branching-out and learning other tools than what are taught in the curriculum.

While there was a good mix of theory and framework/language-specific details, there were times it felt like we could have benefited from lingering on a topic for a week longer. CSS, for example, felt like an afterthought in the curriculum. 

Another great feature of the course were the TAs, who were all extremely smart and helpful. It was also refreshing to simply be around a group of students who were mostly very smart and easy to work with. 

One misconception I had going into the course was that a job would be easy to land after completing the course. While there is a decent alumni network, we were still expected to send out obscene numbers of applications every week.

Their curriculum is HARD.  I've always wanted to live in San Francisco, and I had arrived a day before class so I didn't have time to explore.  3 months later, I still hadn't explored SF because I had ZERO spare time.  Even giving the course 100%,  there's still material that I missed simply because I didn't have the energy to learn because of how tired I was.  Having said that, they cover EVERYTHING.  There is very little that I've heard at my new job that doesn't at least sound familiar from App Academy.  They really go above and beyond to give you the opportunity to learn a little of everything.

It took my 4 months to find a job after graduating, which was stressful.  Having said that, I'm now making literally three-times what I've ever made in my life.  PLUS benefits.  I never thought it was possible.  I've found my dream-job, and now I live in paradise.  I still owe App Academy money, since they don't charge you until you get a job (except for a deposit which is applied to your fees later).  Nevertheless, I am a very happy person.  The three months I spent at App Academy changed my career prospects so much more than my 4-year degree did (depressing, I know).

The job prep was wonderful.  I've heard nightmares about some bootcamps graduating you then throwing you to the sharks.  Since App Academy wants you to pay them, they really help you get a job.

What you will get is an extremely focused curriculum, a no-nonsense environment that motivates people who already have some natural ability, and a lot of very good advice about your job search. App Academy is changing so much and so fast that I hesitate to speak too much about its specific practices when I attended. We didn't get much immediate help with job placement.

234196,2013.0,True,App Academy's tuition model makes them the best boot camp by a long shot,"TL;DR: No exaggeration, App Academy was a life changing experience for me, and if you are willing to work hard it can be life changing for you as well.

I started out with a little experience programming and the idea that I might like to do it professionally and app academy tough me the skills I needed to do just that. The application process requires you to work hard but is also highly rewarding. The prep materials they provide give you a clear path toward what you will need to learn to get accepted. I became a better programmer just by learning the material required to get accepted. 

The program its self is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion its the ideal model for education. Expert teachers, helpful TAs, and a well rounded and diverse group of smart and enthusiastic peers who are just as eager to learn as you are. The peer interaction is one of the best parts of the program, you can easily learn as much if not more from your peers as you will from the lectures and reading. 

The BEST and most unique part of app academy is the tuition model (no tuition until you find a job,  at which you pay a % of your first year salary over time) . This is crucial and something you can not find in any other boot camp that I have ever come across. The fact that they do not get paid until you find a job means that your incentives are aligned with theirs. They have every reason to make the curriculum the best that it can be, and they will support and advise you until you find a job. This also means that you dont have to shell up $10K or more up front like you would with other boot camps  and there is no risk if thing don't work out.

I learned a tremendous amount and made a lot of friends during the program, many of which I am still in touch with today. I attended app academy in October of 2013 and I now work for groupon making 2.5x as much as I made before I was a software dev. Fellow graduates of my cohort are have jobs ranging from big name companies like Tumblr to cool start ups and all to my knowledge found jobs after finishing the program.

234193,,False,Like your dad always told you,"You get out of it what you put into it. 

a/A worked for me. I learned a boatload, had fun, built stuff, and got a great job as a full-stack software engineer at a good company, where I'm also having fun, building stuff, and learning a boatload.

That said, it's NOT a panacea. I watched people struggle to get in, struggle to stay in, struggle to get jobs, and struggle to keep jobs. I also saw other people do very well. 

The program is far from perfect. It's growing faster than it can adapt, leading to problems:
1) Instructor quality varies. There are great lecturers (some of whom have already left since my relatively recent graduation), and there are mediocre lecturers. There are also just straight bad lecturers.
1a) If you rely completely on lecture to learn and understand the material, you're doomed anyways. That's not the point of a bootcamp.

2) Project quality varies. Some of them were honestly mind-blowing. Like, whoa...that's how that works, holy shit, I get it-type projects. Some of them are filler (learning how to do authentication 4 times is an example of teaching to a test, which in a short curriculum, is probably not the best use of time).

3) TAs are usually high-performing students. That's good, if you want to learn from people who graduated shortly before you. It's good for the ratio, but they aren't always able to help you.

4) Job search curriculum makes up 3 weeks of the total 12. In some ways, it was really helpful: whiteboarding, working on projects, and dedicated application time were all helpful! Fuzzy ""you can do it!"" lectures, ghostly ""job seeker counselors"" that were frequently out and less frequently helpful (though encouraging, which is fine), and a general head-in-the-sand approach to the glut of junior (and specifically bootcamp grad) developers out there were all kinda downers, considering this was a quarter of the total course. Increasing the required application # from 100 to 200 is not a good strategy to combat a rapidly saturating market.

BUT - to bring it back to where I started: it does work. You just have to be aware of the limitations of the program so you can make up for them with your personal efforts. Self-teach extensively before considering a bootcamp. Being top 50% isn't really good enough for bootcamp grads anymore (if you want to get a job quickly). Make sure you're top 5%, both in terms of your pre-bootcamp fundamentals and your approach while in the bootcamp, and you'll be insulated from most of the problems outlined above.

There are more positives than problems, so I'll just list them quickly here (nobody wants to read another ""a/A changed my life!!!"" paragraph...right?):
- Current curriculum materials
- More good teachers than poor teachers
- Office space and equipment is reliable, comfortable, pleasant
- The tuition system is truly, uniquely good. They really are motivated to make you successful.
- Relatively diverse (reeelllaaatively), smart, interesting cohort-mates
- A relatively higher standing in the bootcamp-grad-reputation game.",7/15/2016,Bootcamp Prep,3.7,[],4.0,4.0,3.0,app-academy

As an aside: I've gone on to Hackbright Academy and am beyond thrilled with my experiences. My foray into A/a was supportive in some unusual ways. One of those ways was to highlight many of the masculinist and patriarchal cultural values in which the tech community and the App Academy bootcamp are rooted. I was genuinely sad to see so much sexism present in their cohort. I would often arrive early and be in earshot of the full-stack bootcampers and instructors for hours. There were some dicey moments, and a few that made me want to throw my computer out of the window.

Considering the prep course OR bootcamp?
Here are a few highlights from my experience:

It's worth taking the time and spending the money to take a prep course if you are on the fence about diving into a coding camp, or you simply want to get some support jump starting into one. I am not entirely sure I would suggest paying the A/a price if it gives you pause, but if it’s totally manageable and the support will be of assistance: go for it! In many ways I’m thankful for spending my time there.

* I spent time with one of their tutors: that was extremely helpful, reviewing the problems that I struggled to break down into bite sized chunks. I recommend their services if you have the expendable cash, though it would be a LOT cheaper to find 
* The instructors were supportive but I think it was painfully obvious they were coders teaching, and not teachers coding. I have mostly great things to say about their individual styles to teaching. However, their structure seems a bit hap-hazard and thrown together. I would venture a guess that they have filled in most of the curriculum on the fly — and if not, I suggest they take a step back and get organized.
* I know pair programming is a large part of the coding puzzle, yet this program is extremely individualized in a polarizing way. I had expected to be encouraged to work alongside one another, review code together, etc.  Nada. If anything, I feel we were discouraged from doing so.

I knew that I needed an extra push to make the career change, and App Academy seemed like the perfect option. 

The reason I chose App Academy was that they were the only bootcamp that relied on YOUR success as a business model. With the deferred payment model you don't pay until you are employed. This gave me all of the faith that I needed in the program to start my journey!

The coursework is very well put together, and covers an ever-changing array of technologies. They stay up to date, and are always trying to produce the most employable junior developers in the country. If you are thinking about it, just do it.

234188,2016.0,True,Restart your career in under 4 months!,"App Academy was an amazing life experience that I encourage anyone to attend that is looking to transition into the software industry. 

After grinding in finance for 2 years, I was concerned that I would never gain the skills needed to join the fast growing tech industry. Enter App Academy. I attended the SF cohort in March 2016, and in roughly 3 months, they took me from a programming newbie into a software engineer able to push production level code. One month later, I landed a back end engineering position earning roughly $120K.

The secret to the program's success is that the incentives are aligned. UNLIKE ANY OTHER BOOT CAMP, App Academy does not charge you tuition until you are hired. Consequently, the curriculum is extremely hands on and tailored to you gaining the knowledge to be employable. You largely avoid the trivial academic exercises found in a traditional CS program and instead focus on building skills that make you an excellent programmer for companies. 

PROS
-  No tuition fees until you start working (only a refundable security deposit is due upfront, and it is credited towards tuition payments)
-  Excellent lecturers and personalized support from TAs every day to help you when you are stuck on projects and offer advice to write better code
-  Career-driven curriculum to help learn the most important skills companies hire for
-  Beyond thoroughly learning web development, you understand the general concepts needed to teach yourself new languages and technologies efficiently

CONS
-  Intense programming camp that requires constant effort during and after class hours
-  Exceptional self-motivation and time management is needed to survive. You have to be willing to keep up with all assignments and tests, even while job hunting 

BOTTOM LINE
If you are an extremely motivated individual that needs a fresh start in technology, App Academy is your best option.

(Let alone could have gotten in the state the jobs market is in with academia).

I heard about AppAcademy back in the beginning, paid my $3k deposit and moved to New York, and worked my ass off for 12 weeks drinking copious amounts of coffee and learning to code. From the first day of coding to the last day of negotiating my final job offer, a/A was behind me all the way (although I did have to tap into a couple other networks to get hired at a place I liked).

234185,2015.0,True,Aug '15 - Nov '15 Cohort,"Summary: Worth it.  You can learn this stuff on your own, but it will take much, much longer, and it will be harder to convince employers that you have the requisite skills.  While App Academy (and bootcamps) are unknown to some employers, most have heard of the concept and are more willing to take a chance on you than if you have no coding-related experiences on your resume.

Pros:

- Instructors/curriculum: The quality of instruction was really high.  The readings were up-to-date and very clearly written/easy to read.  The assignments were challenging and effective at getting you to understand more thoroughly what you were introduced to via the readings.  The instructor is basically the bulk of what you're paying for -- they are generally great at debugging your code and some are very good at explaining complex concepts.  I think it would've taken me many more months to learn the same materials on my own by digging through resources on the internet. 

- Peers: You'd be surrounded by peers who are smart and passionate about tech. I definitely learned a lot by pairing with different people and picking up their good habits.  It's also a network that you can hang on to after graduation.

Cons:

- Job assistance: This was the weakest part of the program when I attended.  I think the job curriculum (how to write resumes, how to interview, build your portfolio, network, etc.) was much less structured and more under-staffed than the coding part of the program.  I believe this has changed since my cohort (they hired more people and tweaked the curriculum) but I can't comment on how well that's going.  There's also ongoing efforts to create a network of alumni, which I think will be the most helpful for future job applicants.",7/13/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,,[],,,,app-academy

234174,2014.0,True,Fall '14 Cohort Graduate Review,"About two years ago I was feeling stuck and bored in a career as a microbiologist.  I had picked up programming as a hobby and found that I really enjoyed it, but I had no idea how to turn it into a job.   Around that time, programming ""bootcamps"" entered my radar, seemingly presenting a viable means to make the switch.  After some research, I decided a/A was the one for me, largely due to the pricing structure and an excellent review from a friend of a friend that had recently attended.   Let me go off on a tangent here and rave about the pricing structure.  If you're not aware, App Academy charges nothing up front (although there is a deposit).  You don't pay anything until you get a job and then once you do get a job, you pay a percentage of your salary.  This unique model is incredibly fair, allows someone like myself who couldn't afford other bootcamps to attend, and says a lot about what a/A offers.  With this model, a/A would completely fail if what they were offering was anything less than high quality.

The application process was very challenging and took a bit longer than I expected.  The process includes interviews and several coding challenges but you are not penalized for the time it takes to get through it all. a/A even provides a whole bunch of rich materials that, with enough review and practice, should be sufficient enough for one to get through the challenges.  This says a lot about a/A's integrity and accessibility.  a/A has high acceptance standards, but if you are willing to put in the work there's a good chance you'll get in, and a/A wants to help you be successful in doing so.  In fact, I didn't pass the last coding challenge, but since I was close to a solution I was given more material to go through and a second chance.

a/A kicked off at full speed.  I was expecting the program to be challenging and a whole lot of work, and I experienced exactly that.  Days typically consisted of a ""lecture"" in the early morning led by the instructors  where we went over the previous days assignments, went through demos, had a Q&A etc.  Then we jumped into the days assignments which would take up most of the rest of the afternoon and often the evening.  Most days we pair programmed, which was much more fun (and less lonely) than my programming journey had been up until this point.  Seeing others' approaches to problems was also very insightful.  At night we were expected to go over the solutions to the days problems and do the reading for the following day.  We had nearly weekly programming assessments that were often very difficult, primarily due to not being able to use any resources.  I hated the assessments due to the stress they brought me, but they did force us to develop a deep understanding of key concepts.  However, even with regular stresses and working upwards of 100 hours a week, my time at a/A was very enjoyable. The instructors were incredible resources (I wish I took more advantage of this) and I made a ton of great friends.  I have no shortage of fond memories from this period of my life and I was pretty bummed to see it end.

I can't recommend App Academy enough.  I had a great time, the program is of the highest quality, and I couldn't be happier with the results I got.  3 months at App Academy (plus a few months in preparation) got me into a career that I'm very happy to be in and my income has doubled.  How can you beat that?   Also,  6 months after completion my debt to a/A was completely fulfilled.  I graduated from college six years ago and I don't even want to get into how much of that student debt remains.  If you're seriously interested in programming as a profession, make a/A your first consideration.",7/13/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
234176,2015.0,True,Fantastic learning and community at app academy,"I had a fantastic experience with app academy.  It is certainly a stressful few months, but ultimately, it was very much worth it.  Not only did the program help me change careers in a very short time, I was able to land a job after a relatively short time with a good salary, working with an organization whose mission and culture match my values.

I chose app academy over other bootcamps because of its tuition structure and its selectiveness, knowing that I would be surrounded by the sharpest peers and colleagues that I could learn with, and the latter was the most important reason in retrospect. My cohort was exceptional -- I had less programming experience than many of my peers, but the curriculum moves so fast that students of all backgrounds were constantly challenged and engaged.  Sometimes the speed and quantity of assessments felt overwhelming, but it is necessary if you want to learn something as complex as the fundamentals of web development in such a short period of time. 

I'm sure everyone reading this has looked at app academy's website and read other reviews, so I won't get into the hiring stats, salaries, etc., other than to say that my cohort's experience with the job hunt certainly lived up to all of the advertising. Instead, I want to focus on something that I didn't expect before joining app academy, and that is the culture of instruction.  App Academy promotes itself as a rigorous program with great stats, but doesn't necessarily advertise culture, and this made me nervous going into the program (I really liked some other bootcamps' focus on culture). I was extremely happily surprised when I joined app academy -- even if the focus on promoting a positive culture isn't part of the brand, the instructors at app academy did an incredible job fostering positive conversation, promoting inclusiveness during a stressful period, and I can see that they've continued to hire some of the brightest and most empathetic communicators from succeeding cohorts. This was hugely important, but many of the reviews that I read before joining app academy just focused on the challenge and the job hunt.  The instructors are top notch developers and generally great individuals.

Even though I was coming into app academy from a grad school, I was continually amazed at the pace and rigor of the learning experience.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this program.",7/13/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy

The student is highly motivated to learn because if they fail assessments they are dismissed from the program.

234169,2016.0,True,First 2/3rds are world-class; last 1/3rd less so,"Pros:
- Well-managed culture, which fostered cooperation rather than competition
- Extremely supportive network, easy to get help, especially from alumni
- Curriculum is constantly updated to account for new industry trends
- Deferred, scaling tuition structure is extremely appealing (pay based on what you earn)
- Assessment structure ensures that students don't fall behind; from my experience, while the best students across top bootcamps are comparable, App Academy's 'worst' students are far better than the 'worst' students from other boot camps

Cons:
- Availability of resources drastically dropped in the last third of the program (""job search curriculum""); internal tools for this portion of the curriculum were surprisingly poorly designed given the nature of the boot camp
- Severe limitation of TA availability at times during practical coding sessions (being improved with reorganization and increased hiring)
- Drastically differing lecture quality (some were on par with my best college professors, others were absolutely useless -- fortunately in the minority)
- Algorithms curriculum is disorganized and not as helpful as it could be
- Assessments are too easy to perfect score, meaning the margin of error for passing is very low. Thus, students who fail seem to do so most often from dev env problems or anxiety vs. not understanding the material. Assessments should be made harder, with an easier passing score, to account for ceiling effects and to present a more accurate mean / median.

Other Notes:
- More effort can be done to address burnout. Due to the fast pace and challenging nature of the work, many students stop to take a breather once the pressure is off... and never start again. Not listed as a 'con' because this honestly should be the students' responsibility over App Academy, but it is an area where App Academy can make a large impact. App Academy can organize group projects, accountability groups for job seekers, etc.
- Algorithms curriculum received a major upgrade around when I left; from what I can see, there is much more of a formalized structure now",7/13/2016,,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,app-academy
234168,2014.0,True,Hard Work That Will Pay Off,"I graduated from App Academy in December of 2014, and definitely feel like attending was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I now work at an awesome company working on really cool problems as a full stack engineer.

My background: I had taken a couple of college C.S. classes and I had a degree in analytic philosophy. I'd done codeacademy and tried a couple small projects, but I was having trouble making the leap to employment-level skills.

The structure and content of the App Acadaemy curriculum is top notch. They know exactly what is useful and what is not. For example - not useful: rote memorization of code. Useful: learning how to think logically, approach problems with the intention of creating an elegant algorithm, and how to read documentation and quickly pick up new skills. That being said, the tools you learn are also really useful tools to know how to use: they focus on ruby/rails, sql/active record, and javascript/react (when I took the course, it was backbone).

The quality of instruction is incredibly high, and you spend most of your time (probably 80% of the day) actually coding and working on problems. I really liked that, as I definitely learn better by doing, and most of the best learning moments were working with TA's who could explain a concept in practice after getting stuck on a specific part of a problem.

After the course, they have good resources to help you apply and interview for positions. It's still a lot of work, but it's really valuable to hear what actually matters on a resume or cover letter, what interviewers are actually looking for, etc.

I now work at a really cool company, working on stuff way more interesting than anywhere else I've ever worked, and getting paid like 3x more than I was at my old job. I'm using the ruby/rails and js I learned at App Academy, but I'm also using React on the front end, as well as Scala/C++ on the backend. So don't let anyone tell you that you're only qualified in the language you know.

Two quick caveats: 1) This is not a place for people who want to figure out if they'll enjoy software engineering. You have to be committed and ready to work really hard from the beginning. 2) This is not a place for people who have trouble self-motivating. 80-90 hours per week is not a joke, and a lot of that is forcing yourself to work through really complicated readings and problems. After graduating, you won't be handed a job, but you'll have the skills to get a great job if you work hard and keep practicing. But if you're likely to burn out easily or need someone else to push, maybe this isn't the best place for you.

tl;dr:

I remember getting to class around 8:30 every day and leaving around 9PM every night, and spending pretty much all of my weekends in the offices.

Pros:
I didn't bother trying to cook, I felt that there wasn't enough time for anything except program. so I bought food from neighboring restaurants twice a day.
the curriculum generally get you ready for the assessments, which typically helps you understand what you're gonna be doing in the work force.
The staff was very supportive and helpful during the expected(9 to 6) and non-expected hours. Always willing to help.

Cons:
After my co-hort, Three of my favorite staff members's contracts with a/A have ended(or they decided to leave, I'm not sure which). The staff who teaches/helps teach rotate per co-hort as they generally hire students after they graduate.
My cohort was the largest cohort at the time. and there wasn't enough staff members to accomodate with all of the students at times. once in a while we would be waiting for someone to help us out longer than we would expect usual.
They're in a newer location(in the financial district) of San Francisco. While it does look nicer and accomodates for more students.
The job search curriculum was fairly new when I finished my course as well. At the time, the person in charge only had one other staff member. They've grown since.

Every issue I've had with a/A has been addressed in the cohorts after me.

243199,2015.0,True,"over-hyped, so-so program with terrible job support","Pros.... you don't have to pay until you get a job is good for some people. The office is nice and centrally located. The ratio of TAs to students is good. Some of the projects are very interesting and unique to A/A (you get to create your own object relational mapper for example). They do cover data structures and algorithms which are important for interviews.

Cons... Their ""money-back"" guarantee contract is actually ridiculous. You only don't have to pay tuition if you search for an entire year after the program is over and don't find a job (you aren't allowed to hold even part-time work in your previous position for that entire year).

They test their students every week and kick out the students who don't perform well, so this inflates their statistics on percentage of students who find a job vs other bootcamps who don't kick out students. Plus it makes everyone way stressed out. Even so, their time to placement is way too long (after 3 months, ~50% of grads are employed), compare that to Hack Reactor's stats of 80%!). 

They have terrible post-graduation job support that mostly involves pushing students to bulk-spam companies. Basically, forget about picking where you want to work, just get an offer anywhere that will give you one because let's face it, we're in a coding bootcamp bubble. There are now way more bootcamp graduates than there are openings for junior-level software engineers in SF and most employers don't think A/A graduates are any better/different from Dev Bootcamp/General Assembly/Coding Dojo, etc grads. All students are required to submit 200+ applications to companies.

234153,2016.0,True,It's All about You,"The course that I took before making it to every coding bootcamp I applied to was the Bootcamp Prep offered by App Academy.

Going into this course I didn't do it because I wanted to raise my chances of getting into other bootcamps, I did it because I had applied to App Academy once already and with their strict no redo policy, this was a way for me to apply once again. The first time applied, I had tried to learn things on my own. My journey shortly ended after the second basic coding challenge. This sort of gives you a picture of how much coding experience I had going into the Prep course(not enough). 

My results after finishing the month long prep course changed a lot of things for me. Not only was I applying to other bootcamps I was getting into all of them. I got accepted into all of the bootcamps I applied to, and I applied to all of the hard ones including the notoriously competitive App Academy and Hack Reactor. 

The details of the course can be found on their website so I won't go into that here. The reason I say this course is all about you is because you have one month to get into the bootcamp of your dreams, put your all into it. If you're looking for a bootcamp prep course, I am assuming you already am ready to commit some 3 months of your life to flip it upside down. The same idea applies to this course, you have 1 month to make those 3 months a reality. Those 3 months bootcamps that you dreamt of, you can have your pick of the litter and make it your reality. 

There were three students that stood out to me in the course, myself included. One thing we had in common was that we did not have other time commitments. This does not mean you need to drop everything just yet. The course I took was part time accessible for a reason. 

The curriculum covered everything I was being tested on and more. As long as you grasp concepts and can write code accordingly, you will be in great shape. I assume the tests will only get harder as the years go by but I know App Academy is an adaptive school and I wouldn't be surprised if they adapt their curriculum as the times change. 
The ""Job Support"" is what I consider to be their application support. Coming out of this prep course you apply to bootcamps, not jobs, but I consider this to be the equivalent. It was good. There were extra materials to work on and mock interviews to be scheduled.

I can't vouch for any other bootcamp prep courses. Even if the curriculum is the same, the experience could be completely different. I went to App Academy's Bootcamp Prep Course and I hit the jackpot. Things click for me. I'm not a wiz, remember I failed after the second basic coding challenge, never mind the technical interview, but after the course I killed it all.

234152,2016.0,True,"App Academy was awesome, but make sure you come prepared","Prior to App Academy, I have been learning coding on my own through various online resources. It was nice that I was able to go at my own pace and learn what I wanted to, but after some time, I knew that I wanted to accelerate my learning and find a position as a software engineer. Hence, after researching and reading many reviews, I applied to App Academy. After completing the technical interview with App Academy, I was accepted into the March cohort. I completed the 4 week prep work that was required prior to starting, and went in enthusiastic and ready to learn. 

For me, the course was a load of fun. From Monday - Friday, from 9 - 6 (with a 1 hour 15 minute lunch break and a 15 minute break), it was all about learning and coding. My personal schedule was to wake up at 6:00 AM, get to App Academy by 7:30 - 8:00 AM, and review the readings / homework assignment before class started at 9:00. After 6:00, I would look over the solution for the day's work, and prepare for the next day. I would usually go to bed by 10:30 PM, with the latest being 11:00 PM, as I believed getting enough sleep was the key to me being able to focus throughout the immense workload that App Academy entails. However, everyone in my cohort was different, so what worked for me might not have worked for someone else. Finding the balance and schedule that worked for me was key to keeping my momentum going and not get burnt out. The good news is, it was only for 3 months, so even though it was tough every day, it didn't continue for years. I did enjoy learning and coding constantly, and it was amazing how much I learned at the end of the curriculum, with a full-stack project that I am pretty damn proud of. I would actually look forward to Mondays, as it was another day to continue to grow my skill set and build cool things. 

The most stressful part was probably the assessments. The policy at App Academy is that you are only allowed to fail 1 out of the 6 given. If you fail two, you are released from the program. That's why it is important to keep on top of the material, and make sure you have a deep understanding of the concepts that are taught. They do provide practice assessments that closely follow the actual assessment, though they are different, so you can't just memorize the practice assessment. It is highly recommended that you take the month-long prep work that is given before the start of the main course seriously, as everything from the curriculum builds on top of it.

The part I enjoyed least was the job searching process. While App Academy does provide lectures about algorithms for technical interview questions, I found it very difficult to get through the resume screening to even get a chance for a phone screen. My other classmates had more success than me though, so I might have just been an unusual case. They tell you it's a numbers game, and that you have to apply to many to get a few hits. It was tiring and demoralizing, but I eventually got through it and landed a job. I would recommend saving enough money to last you not only the 3 months of the main curriculum, but also for the job search process as well, as the amount of time it takes to find a job is uncertain. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at App Academy. You are surrounded by motivated and talented individuals, and everyone is working together to get through it. You are challenged to learn a crap load of information everyday, and you will be amazed at what you can achieve in a short amount of time. Without App Academy, I would not have been confident to even apply to software engineering jobs.",7/13/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,4.3,[],5.0,5.0,3.0,app-academy

Good coverage of basics of Rails; I was there before they switched to React, but the Backbone.JS we did was also solid and useful. Included a lot of useful tooling advice to get a fast setup going.
Also, the algorithms minicurriculum and whiteboarding pair exercises were helpful practice for interviews, though as a former math major I did not really need either.

Cons: For job search, you're pretty much totally on your own. Their network is laughably small, and the advice given was mediocre, limited and unhelpful. I've talked to the people they've hired to beef that up since, and I'm pretty sure it's gotten worse. Imagine the worst stereotype of a high school guidance counselor; they've got several, and they're all alums who couldn't find a job at all and weren't technically skilled enough to be considered for instructors of the proper curriculum.

I did find a job eventually, unrelated to the 200 applications sent they recommend; I went to a few meetups, and happened to salvage a bad one by talking to someone who'd asked for job seekers and hadn't actually had anyone speak up. Then again, I was underprepared for the job and couldn't hold it.",7/13/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,2.7,[],2.0,5.0,1.0,app-academy
234151,2016.0,True,AppAcademy Bootcamp Prep Course,"AppAcademy conducted a 3 week in-depth JavaScript cohort in February to prepare students with the technical knowledge needed to be successfully enrolled at a coding bootcamp.  I enrolled in their first incarnation of this course and was excited to turn my passion into tangible skills.  After the first 3 days it was apparent that my skills were growing at a rate I hadn't had while I was self-teaching for months.  By the end of the second week I was already confident I could pass any entrance exam or interview at a bootcamp.  Then both of my instructors (Anthony and Winnie) conducted multiple mock coding interviews and helped us apply to any bootcamp(s) we were interested in.  I was accepted into three bootcamps (HackReactor, AppAcademy, CodingDojo) within a month of completing this course.  I decided to go with AppAcademy and without a doubt I would not be where I am today without this course.",7/13/2016,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,app-academy
234150,2016.0,True,Great Bootcamp Prep Course,"I took the bootcamp prep course in NYC in April when it first launched here and it was a fun experience. Our instructor, Fred, guided us through all the fundamentals of JavaScript; we even covered some material that a good number of bootcamps don't require us to know about beforehand. Fred is as efficient as a programming instructor can be. He takes the time to answer all our questions, but, at the same time, makes sure we go through each lecture fast enough so that we have time to work on the assignments ourselves. While we're working on our assignments, he comes around and checks on our progress, and helps those who are struggling or have questions. 

Bootcamp prep classes are 2 hours a day, Monday to Friday for a month. That means that you can do it while working. I wasn't, but several of my classmates, at the time, were. You should be aware, however, that to do well in it, you're going to need to dedicate another hour or two to it. I spent an average of 4-5 hours a day on it, completing assignments and reading the lecture notes beforehand.

Other things that might be of particular interest: (1) You're free to use either Windows, OSX, or Linux. (I used Windows.) However, FYI most coding bootcamps require a Mac for their full stack web development courses. (2) You might be wondering, why does the prep course teach JavaScript? That's because most bootcamps let (or require) you to interview in JavaScript. (3) The course has an online discussion forum, set up via a website called Piazza. Since the course itself runs in parallel with the bootcamp prep courses in other areas, you can ask for help from other bootcamp prep instructors and students from across the nation. (The course was only set up in SF and NY when I took it, but it now seems like more locations have opened.) (4) If you're taking this course to get into App Academy's full stack web development course, you get to skip the pre-challenge and move straight to a 45-min technical interview.

Overall, the bootcamp prep course is a big investment, but it will increase your chances of getting in a top bootcamp. I worked through the practice exercises for the technical interview for App Academy's full stack web development course, and I believe that I was able to solve all of them due to the fact that I had acquired the logical thinking required through constant coding at Bootcamp Prep. Reading about how to program is one thing, but doing it is another. The bootcamp prep course will give you the practice you need to begin thinking like a programmer.",7/13/2016,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,app-academy

233173,2014.0,True,"Intense program, interesting incentive structure, great friends","The facts--

I attended the June 2014 cohort. The rest of this review is specific to my experience. The program is constantly changing and will be different today. 
Curriculum in RoR and js/Backbone (they now teach React instead)
Large time investment. Class is 9-6pm, with additional homework. Classtime is structured with a short morning lecture and going over the work from the day before (1hr - 3hr). The rest of the day is pair programming on the topics covered, typically with a complete product at the end of the day. Eg, tic tac toe, chess, a chat app that communicates over websockets. 
Pair programming is overseen by TAs and instructors. (I think it was 1 TA/instructor per 7 students in my time)
Week 9 ends with the completion of a web app of your design. Week 10-12 covers the job search, doing interviews, improving your code, etc. 

Pros--

Provided structure and guidance that I couldn't have gotten otherwise. 
'Don't pay until you get a job' was the only way that I could afford a bootcamp (without credit card debt). 
Actually makes you code instead of just teaching you code.
Pair programming is great to see different coding styles, to learn how to explain your code, and to disseminate best practices.
Made a lot of good friends/network. All of my current roommates are a/a grads.

Cons--

There is a $3k deposit, so not totally free.
I benefitted a lot from being able to live in the office. This is no longer an option. 
Large initial time investment if you're starting from scratch. I had never coded before starting the application process. It took ~a month of self teaching on nights and weekends before I had the background to complete the application. 

Other--
LOTS of work. There are assessments. You will be kicked out if you consistently perform poorly. ~10% of my cohort was kicked out.",1/6/2016,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,[],5.0,,,app-academy

After I was hired, my team went on to hire two more App Academy graduates and several of my coworkers have reached out to me for advice on App Academy and have referred their friends and family to the program. The program is not easy and there is always more to learn, there was definitely a lot of caffeine and many long nights, but the payoff for me has been huge. The course teaches you the fundamentals of coding, how to tackle large projects, how to write clean code, and how to interview– a very different skill than how to work as a engineer. I've since spent a lot of time on hiring committees and I'm amazed at the average level of preparedness compared to the prep I received going through App Academy.  At the end of the day, the job search and contract negotiation advice I received at App Academy is one of the most valuable things I took from the program.

Curriculum is well designed at of the appropriate depth and pace
Fun projects to drive concepts home and learn more deeply

Cons:

Instructors are often more concerned with chatting among themselves than helping students
Since the curriculum is constantly evolving, many exercises are described poorly leading to confusion among students
Job placement help is almost non-existent. Many text resources available with general advice, but few connections to actual employers. A basic resume format is suggested and a half-assed resume review is given to each student. Contrast to Hack Reactor where the students resumes were very polished and even included a mini-portfolio. At our hiring day there were maybe 4 companies present. Again contrast that with the Hack Reactor hiring day I went to to try and recruit students for my current job where there were over a dozen employers actively recruiting.
Student to teacher ratio is 8-10 to one, but at any given time at least one of the teachers is extremely new or is checked out because they're actively trying to find work elsewhere, or they're busy chatting about bullshit together.

232225,2013.0,True,App Academy changed my life,"This is a response to AlanS. 

I took the course back in July 2013 (looks like this is the second review coming from this cohort) and as far as I'm aware, my classmates and I all received our deposits back at the end of the course as agreed upon. If you don't mind me asking, have you personally taken the course? I had an great experience at AA - I learned more in just the first month than I had on my own in a year, and I had no prior programming experience other than dabbling with online tutorials. I can confidently say that attending AA has changed my life. And I can't speak for the present, but during my class, the two lead instructors were not former students.

In response to your claim that they hire on the majority of the graduates to boost placement - I can attest that this is untrue. In my cohort, the top performing student was offered a teaching assistant position, while everyone else (including myself) participated in the standard job search. I graduated in the bottom half of my class, but I did land a job I was happy with after a 2-month search. Granted, it was not an easy process, and there were many rejections along the way, but what do you expect?

Not trying to be confrontational here, but from your post it sounds like you have not done your research. This program has done a lot for me personally so I feel obligated to get the facts out.

231672,2013.0,True,"I'm very happy I decided to attend AA. It's not perfect, but it does have lots going for it in comparison to other dev bootcamps.","I'm very happy I decided to attend AA. It's not perfect, but it does have lots going for it in comparison to other dev bootcamps.

I think programming camps share many similar attributes - for instance, almost all of them learn in pairs, teach Rails, have very experienced programmers teaching, etc. I'll focus comments on what I differs from the norm in AA. Most of these differences are observed second-hand, through interviewing candidates from other bootcamps for the place I work now.

Pros
AA spends time developing algorithmic thinking. We started off barely knowing enough Ruby to run nested for loops to solve 'Fizz Buzz'. In the next 5 days we implemented a lot of things like binary search and quick sort. At the end of the first week, we built Tic Tac Toe allowing human players to play  through the terminal against an unbeatable AI in 8 hours (that was nuts!). A few weeks later we took 5 days to learn all the same things in Javascript. Many of the junior programmers I've interviewed from other camps knew a lot of ways to do things with Rails, but didn't know how to script well enough in plain old Ruby/JS.
AA taught object-oriented and social programming. Our code was constantly evaluated for object-oriented thinking, clarity in choice of variable and function names, and accessibility to other programmers. Really handy now when I'm working with 6 other engineers!
AA taught away the magic. AA's instructors taught this super well - nothing is magical. In the course we did things like rebuild Active Record through meta programming, recreate the basics of Backbone.js using plain Javascript, implement our own sessions/login before using Devise/Sorcery, read server logs to detect and get rid of N+1 queries, and other things that dig deeper into frameworks that many take for granted.
They know what companies are looking for. I was fortunate enough to get 5 offers in 4 weeks of searching after AA. They really prepared me for the job search.
Cons
AA's curriculum covers less overall material. I think the course was a little too light on coverage of CSS. We also didn't cover some classic Rails patterns, like making forms work through AJAX with Rails' forms using remote: true ( we did cover how to AJAXify through plain old JS, obviously). Finally, I wish we had spent more time learning to code through TDD. It's a tradeoff for focusing more deeply.
AA is extremely fast-paced. You have to work hard to keep up. Definitely reminded me of 'drinking from the firehose' in my MIT days. 

Your brain will hurt a lot. You will stress over keeping up and doing the homework after coding for 10 hours straight. But, in the end, it's all worth it.

245141,2013.0,True,,"<p>This is a personal story.&nbsp;

I graduated from the July 13&#39; cohort. I was attracted to AA&nbsp;(App Academy)because I liked their pay later model. If they were willing to bet on me than I felt comfortable betting on them. I was able to find a job within two months of graduation and I&#39;m still working there now (I&#39;m loving it!). The bet paid off.

AA was the most intense experience I&#39;ve ever had. I came in with limited RoR/JS knowledge and I learned a ton over the course of the program. I personally liked the fact that several students had more experience than I did. Although at times discouraging, it ultimately motivated me to push hard; I was determined to not fall behind. It blew my mind that by the end of the ninth week I could build a web-app front-to-back. For real.

Not everyone makes it though. I&#39;ve personally been told there have been scenarios where students were refunded their deposit in unfortunate scenarios. Ned and the staff give more attention to the people who seem to need it. It&#39;s pretty clear they want everyone to succeed, it seems genuine too, regardless of their financial incentives.

It amazes me how after the program I am able to have high-bandwidth conversations with experienced engineers. Although we learned Rails, I&#39;m currently writing a web-app for work in Flask (Python micro-framework). Picking it up was chill because I understood fundamental web and MVC concepts. More importantly, I learned &quot;how to learn.&quot; The skills you gain from AA go beyond Rails/JS, you gain a skill-set to become a real programmer.

AA was an experience I will never forget. I worked my ass off, met a lot of motivated people, and got my dream job working as a professional programmer.

I came in without much technical knowledge and left with the foundational knowledge, skills and confidence needed to grow and thrive in the field of cyber security. Springboard strategically put together a diverse curriculum that exposes students to the many different facets of cyber security. The curriculum contains videos, labs and projects and students are paired with a mentor which they meet with once per week. The mentors, career coaches , administrative and support staff are all amazing and pleasant to deal with. Students meet with career coaches periodically throughout the program and also have access to them for 6 months after graduation. All the career coaches I have met with were amazing. The job guarantee support is good from what I hear, however I did not sign up for the guarantee option so I can only speak so much on it. I will say, that as a non job guarantee student , the job support and career resources have been fantastic. This program is entirely online, offering students flexibility if they have other obligations in their personal and professional lives. If you are looking for an in person experience, you may have to consider something else. What you get out of this program is what you put in so try to get the most out of all the resources Springboard makes available to its students. Some things that helped me were taking good notes and asking the mentors and career coaches lots of questions. Springboard also hosts weekly office hours giving you another opportunity to ask any questions you may have.

300581,2022.0,False,Cyber Security Bootcamp,"<p>I have completed the Springboard Cybersecurity bootcamp and gotten my CompTIA Security + certification. I was part of the March 2022 cohort and completed my bootcamp on October 16 2022. I completed my Job Guarantee period (6 months) without receiving any offers and got a full refund from the program. Executive Summary: I would NOT recommend this bootcamp to anyone. After not being able to get a Cybersecurity job my Career coach advised me to look at Help Desk potions. The bootcamp does not give you the skills required by help desk positions. (Also, I did not take a Cybersecurity bootcamp so that I could work at a help desk.) The material you are given is not unique to Springboard. The technical material is LinkedIn learning videos that can be accessed for $30 a month with a LinkedIn Premium membership. The instructions for the mini-projects are vague and incomplete. The mentors are not well screened. I was ghosted by 2 mentors in my first week. It also seems like they are also not given all the material necessary to properly help students through the course. I do not believe that the material presented in this bootcamp alone would prepare you to take and pass the CompTIA Security plus exam. About me: I have a bachelors in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly SLO. I have worked at Lockheed Martin for almost 7 years as a Systems Engineer. I worked as a Customer Support Engineer for Orbotech for 6 months. I have been a stay at home dad since 7/2015. During that time I also completed the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity. Decision to join Springboard: I made the decision to take the Springboard bootcamp because on previous attempts to get back into the work force employers saw my career gap as a negative. I wanted to put something recent on my resume and show employers that I was still able to work/learn. I had been reading a lot in the news about cyber attacks and how they had become more frequent and how there was a shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity seemed like a good area to go into since already had a technical background. I thought taking the bootcamp and getting my CompTIA Security + certificate would allow to get a job without having to go back to square one in my career, like going back to taking a help desk job. To join the boot camp I did an intake interview. During the interview I talked to an admission person and explained to him why was joining the bootcamp. He talked to me about the program and what to expect. The main reasons for choosing the springboard bootcamp over other bootcamps were: Its significantly cheaper than other bootcamps. Offers a job guarantee. If I don&rsquo;t get a job in 6 months after completing I get my money back. None of the other boptcamps I looked at had this. One on One mentorship. Was suppose to be focused more on blue team (defense) then red team (hacking). It was done through Self paced online learning. Job hunting after the bootcamp: I will get back to the bootcamp in just a minute. After completing the bootcamp successfully and getting my CompTIA Security plus certificate I started the job hunting process around 10/16/2022. After 6 months and applying to over 140 jobs (some were more EE oriented but the vast majority were cybersecurity) I have had no offers. I have had multyiple interviews with recruiters and a few interviews with hiring managers but. The reason for this seems to be that the industry believes that Cybersecurity is not an entry level job. In order to get an &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; job in cybersecurity you need years of experience in IT. This is what is being told to me by recruiters, cyber security professionals that I talk to, and is being said all over LinkedIn posts. I talked to my career counselor about this and she suggested I start looking at IT support roles or Help desk positions and that I should my salary expectations 50-60K a year. When I looked at Help desk positions the pay is closer to 40K a year with no benefits. So I tried applying for IT roles and I got one interview. During the interview the person told me I was not what they were looking for, they wanted someone with more IT experience and that IT was not an entry level position. The skills they are looking for were windows troubleshooting, macOS troubleshooting, linux troubleshooting, what to do if one computer on your network can not see a network printer but all the other can. These are not skills covered in the Springboard Cybersecurity Bootcamp. After I talked to my Career counselor I talked to a Senior Career Service Manager about my experience. \ The Manager also tried to say that the change could be due to the changing job market. But I talked to someone else (the week of 1/16/2023) that just did her intake interview and she was also told that she would be able to get a Cybersecurity Engineering position. This person was told that IT positions and Help desk positions were not qualifying positions for the job guarantee and therefore she would not be advised to apply to these roles. This is the exact opposite of what I am experiencing in the job search. The manager also told me that perhaps the person doing my intake interview did not understand that I was making a career transition which would affect my earning potential. However I talked to another springboard student who was transition from being a hairdresser to cybersecurity and she was also told that she would be able to earn between 90-130K after the bootcamp. So while the manager tried to give me lots of different reasons for why the information given to me during the intake interview did not match what I am experiencing during the job hunt, none of them really held any water. I have also not seen any materialization of these &ldquo;industry partnerships&rdquo; that were discussed during both the intake interview and the course. They have a partnership with a job board &ldquo;Power to Fly&rdquo; but when I look for cybersecurity jobs there I find nothing. And also, it is just another job board, nothing really special about it. I filled out Springboards &ldquo;Employer Partnership On boarding Form&rdquo;, have not heard anything from that. I get a monthly newsletter about jobs and the last one had 1 cybersecurity job listed on it, but like the ones I find myself it required years of experience. I asked the Senior Manager of the Careers department about this. She told me that it&rsquo;s been really hard and slow to develop industry partnerships within cybersecurity. Well if they have not been able to build these industry partnerships then they should not be advertising them during the intake interview or the course work. I also talked with another Senior Manager at Career Services and the conversation went pretty much the same. I also talked with a Senior Director of Admissions at Springboard. He semed to loisted to me more then the previous people. He said he would take my feedback and share it with his team but no immediate help for me. The boot camp: The Point system and Time estimates: Since the bootcamp is self paced all the material is done via online videos. Almost all the videos are LinkedIn learning videos. You can get access to LinkedIn learning for $30 a month. For sixth months (the amount of time the bootcamp is suppose to take) that would be $180. If you pay for the bootcamp all up front, one of the cheapest ways if not the cheapest way, its $9900. Springboard does not provide extra notes, or enrichment material for these videos. It&rsquo;s just a link that takes you to LinkedIn and plays the video. The boot camp assigns point to all the assignments that you are suppose to complete. In order to finish the bootcamp in 6 months they recommend you complete about 400 point a week. They advertise that this should take 13-20 hours a week. I talked to several students who were enrolled at the same time as me and none of them finished in six months. I also took longer than six months to complete. The problem with this is that there time estimates that are shown per video are wrong. For example in Section 5.1 they say the time is between 3 hours 15 minutes and 4.5 hours. This broken down into 2 hours 55 minutes to 4 hours to watch the course and 20-30 minutes to take notes. The total runtime of the video is 3 hours and 20 minutes. How do you watch a 3 hour 20 minute video in 2 hours and 55 minutes? If the total runtime of the video is 3 hours 20 minutes then the minimum amount of time for the exercise should be 3 hours 20 minutes. This section is even worse because there were multiple exercises, quizzes, a test, and extra documentation to read with this video. If you do all of the exercises in the video and the quizzes and the test I would estimate this section taking 8.5 hours. I remember there was another section where springboards max time estimate was 30 mins short of the runtime of the LinkedIn learning video. Almost all the sections have this problem, where the minimum time that springboard estimates is less than the run time of the video. Most are only 5-10 minutes but it starts to add up over the course of the entire bootcamp. And these times are how they calculate the points for each video and therefore effects the time it takes to get your 400 points per week. When you gain access to springboards course there will be a timeline shown and it will break down which sections you should be completing each week. But this timeline does not align with the 400 points per week. There was one week where the timeline said I should only complete 230points. These might not seem like major errors but when you pay $9900 for a course I would expect it to not have this many simple errors, I mean how hard it to make sure the time listed on your course matches the time given by LinkedIn? Mini Projects: Another element to the course is what they call &ldquo;mini-projects&rdquo;. These mini-projects can be anything from reading an article and answering a coupled of questions about it to writing a script in python or pearl. Often times the instructions to these mini-projects were ambiguous. Here is some feedback I gave to Springboard about Mini Project 8 and 9: In the video Project Management Foundations the presenter kept saying we would get all the specific information that we would need for the documentation from the Key Stake holders. So obviously we do not have actual stake holders we can sit down with and pick their brains for information. So I would have expected to have more details about the project in information pack given. But no, the information given was very limited. For example, mini project 8 the project was to &ldquo;install wifi&rdquo; for a hair salon. Well the first question is, what does &ldquo;install wifi&rdquo; mean. Does it mean just install a wifi router, does she need an ISP with wifi, does she want the &ldquo;social wifi&rdquo; talked about in the links provided in the document? I decided to go with the most literal interpretation which is to install a wifi router. This however seems to make the project ridiculously simple and not worth the effort of going through project management process. I mean in the real world her ISP would probably provide her with a wifi router as part of her monthly subscription, mine does. So maybe more realistic project would be better. I see it says that some of the information was left out on purpose to make exercise what we learned but the project definition should not be some of the information that is left out. Mini-project 9 suffers from some of the same problems as mini-project 8. Lack of definition, lack of information that would come form the stake holders. But there is more, the information in the packet provided is contradictory. In the objectives it says you want to deploy Windows 10 by January 2020 but then in the timeline you don&rsquo;t even start work tell second quarter 2021. Also the roadmap delivery timeline indicates that work will go from Q2 2021 to Q1 2022, so less then a year. But in the Phase one Recommendations you have a task that is going to take 800-1600 days (2.2-4.4 years), so how do those work out? In the videos we watched it indicated that when you had problems like these you went to your stake holders and talked about it and got clarification or came up with a solution, but we have no stake holders to go to. I looked for help on slack and what I found was &ldquo;make it up to fit&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what I did and it work but if you are giving us a project to learn project management why make it more difficult and frustrating by not providing all the information or providing contradictory information? Why not give us clear information so we can understand what we are doing better and get a better experience? In another mini-project we are suppose to write a Pearl script. Just before the project there is video go over how to write scripts in Pearl. Just so you know, the bootcamp says you do not need any previous coding experience to complete the bootcamp. The video goes over how to download pearl to your computer and set up your Integrated development environment (IDE). Since I know I will need to write a pearl script after watching the video I try and follow the steps in the video. However the steps in the video do not work because the websites referenced in the video have changed (the video is from 2016). I go to the springboard slack channel and find other students have had the same problem and they have posted a work around. A representative form springboard responded to posts about the problem (they did not give a solution) and the solutions the students posted. These posts were already 6 months old at the time. This means Springboard new about the problem, knew what the solution was, and yet did not update the course material for at least six months. All they had to do was write up the steps given in slack into a document and post the document under this section on the website. For a competent web designer this should have only taken a few hours at most. In another mini-project they asked us to setup a phishing campaign using the GoPish software. This was one part of mini-project and the total time for the mini-project was estimated to be around 4 hours I believe. There were several problems for this mini-project. They did not provide us with detailed instructions on how to make GoPish work; just the tutorial the website provides which is not great. I was not able to get it to work properly but submitted the steps that I believed would make it work. When I talked to my mentor about it he said that the first time he used GoPhish it took him several days to get it to work properly. How can springboard expect students who are not cyber security experts to make this work in a couple hours when it takes experienced Cybersecurity personal a couple days to get it setup right? I have previously provided this feedback to Springbaord and the response I get is them saying that they have flagged the feedback for review and are considering making changes. I also remember reading on the slack a Springboard representative saying they leave the instructions somewhat ambiguous on purpose to allow the students to figure out their own solutions. But if you read what the students are posting on the Slack channel what is actually happening is that the students are being confused and getting frustrated by the lack of clear direction. Labs: Part of the Springboard course is doing labs. For these labs they have contracted with a company called Infosec learning. You log into the webpage and its sets up a virtual environment for you to conduct your lab. The main problem I have with these labs are that the instructions are so dumbed down that you do not have to think to complete the lab and therefore I think the information retention form them is minimal. For example the instructions don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;close the window&rdquo; they say &ldquo;close the window by clicking on the red x in the upper right hand corner.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;search for term xyz&rdquo; they say &ldquo;Type xyz into the search field and then use the cursor to click on the arrow at the right of the search field to conduct the search&rdquo;. Those might not be the exact instruction they give but you get the idea. This is how you give instructions to people who are not familiar with the basics of using a computer not to people who are taking an online bootcamp. This might seem minor but if you are familiar with how to use computers and have to slog through reading pages of instruction like this it becomes boring and detracts from the learning experience. Mentors: Part of the Springboard bootcamp is that you have 1 on 1 meetings with a mentor every week. The mentors are people who work in the industry and are supposed to answer your questions about the course material or the projects or just about the industry in general. When I joined I was setup to have my first mentor meeting on Wednesday of the first week. The mentor did not show for the meeting. I let Springboard know, they set me up with a second mentor for Friday. The second mentor did not show. I was then set up with a third mentor who did show up to the meeting. I never found out why the first two mentors did not show. I went on the Springboard Slack channel and asked if other people were having this problem. While no one else had two mentors ghost them, I do remember people saying that they had mentors show up late, were in rush to leave, or just did not seem that good at explaining cybersecurity. It seems like Springboard needs to revise their screening for their mentors. Another feature of the Bootcamp is On demand mentors. If you have a question in between your regularly scheduled mentor meetings you can schedule a meeting with an on demand mentor. I had a problem with one of the mini-projects because the instructions were incomplete so I scheduled an on demand mentor. The problem I was having was I did not understand what value they wanted me to put in a column of a spreadsheet. I asked my on demand mentor what I was suppose to put in this column and his answer was something like &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; How can he not know, part of his job is to help students with projects. If he had students assigned to him he would be grading these projects. Shouldn&rsquo;t Springboard have given him templates of what the finished projects look like so he knows how to grade them and answer these questions? Another thing that I saw was mentors on the same slack channel as the students, asking for guidance or examples on how to grade the mini-projects because they did not know the answers. I would think there would be some kind of on boarding for the mentors where springboard takes them through the mini-projects and what is expected in each one. Or at the very least would provide them with examples to compare to. I would also think the mentors should have their own slack channel so that they can communicate without the students seeing it. After all you don&rsquo;t want them answering each other question and showing the answer to the students on the slack channel.</p>",4/24/2023,Cyber Security Career Track,1.3,[],1.0,2.0,1.0,springboard

It was very nice to have a professional mentor to meet with every week. It was good accountability to stay on track, and it also helped me to comprehend how the material I&#39;m learning is applicable in the workforce. I wish I would have acquired a stronger foundation in the technical skills, namely SQL and Python, however, those skills are not focal points in this program.

Pros: - Dedicated mentor that can guide you and provide critical feedback - Job guarantee - Career coach calls - Industry Design Project (IDP) to give you real-world experience Cons: - No live instruction - A lot of the curriculum is just links to online articles (like medium) that you could ostensibly self-study. - Expensive</p>",4/15/2023,UI/UX Design Career Track,3.7,[],5.0,3.0,3.0,springboard

There was one part of the course that was a learn along video mini course, and there were a few challenges like this as well. I wish they would incorporate more of those, as most of the material is article reading. If you&#39;re a distracted reader, this can be a challenging, frustrating way to learn. But they are also really great about making you practice the new things you learn, so you&#39;re actively doing UX/UI work from very early on instead of just consuming information. My mentor was incredible and helped me grow tremendously. The career coaches are great too, and my internship was such an impactful thing for my career. I learned a ton and really felt like I was working in the field - collaborating with other UX researchers and presenting to stakeholders. I would definitely recommend this course to people who are diligent and can manage a self-paced, independent curriculum. I would have liked it more if there had been more collaboration with other students peppered throughout the course, instead of just at the end. And of course having professors would be ideal.

298981,2023.0,False,Springboard was a great fit for my learning style,"<p>Deciding factors for choosing Springboard: - After trying to map out my learning journey, I was very overwhelmed and decided a bootcamp would provide the structure I needed to have a well-rounded base education. - I knew I needed a bootcamp with flexibility. Prior to joining, and throughout the course, I was working through the burn out of my previous career, and needed to also work on my personal and mental health. The in person / virtual bootcamps I looked into had very demanding schedules, which I didn&rsquo;t feel would allow me the time to absorb the information as well. This was also confirmed after speaking with students in those programs. - Prior to my decision to join a bootcamp, I had been studying from Colt&rsquo;s videos, and enjoyed his teaching style. - Having career support was a huge bonus, as this is something I knew I needed additional help with, and was not something I saw in other programs. - Having the job guarantee was a nice bonus safety net, and was something that would keep me accountable. Other things to note after completing the course: - While completing assignments/projects on my own, my peers in other programs were completing similar projects as a team. I think I learned more by completing the assignments on my own, but I do feel I missed out on the group work experience. This being said, I think there were opportunities to fill this gap, if I participated more in the Slack community. I lean more towards the introverted side, so I tended to prioritize learning on my own instead of being proactive in these conversations. - The Springboard Support staff (relating to all things outside the curriculum) was always very helpful and responsive. - The Career staff provided great support. Being able to speak candidly with recruiting experts greatly boosted my confidence. Also speaking with these experts reduced a lot of the informaiton overload from searching the internet. - Breaks and Pauses were extremely beneficial in allowing me to successfully complete the course. - In my experience I found the Peer Mentors in the Slack community to be more helpful than working with the on-demand mentors for assignment questions. What I would change if I were to do it again: - Coming into the program with little experience I wish I had planned for the course to take the full 9+ months. Many materials required additional research outside the course, multiple views of the videos, and additional time completing the exercises. - Participated more in the Slack community. - Having 1:1 meetings with a mentor in the professional community (separate from the Peer mentors, and on-demand mentors) was a great learning opportunity, although I feel I did not utilize the experience enough.

There is a lot of reading in this course and some videos mixed in to go through at your own pace. The subunits are structured pretty well to start from zero. For those that are doing this bootcamp part time and putting in 16-20 hours per week, I think it&#39;s easy to get burnt out over the course of 9 months. I got burnt out after 1 month. Personally, I wanted more hands on from mentors and from the program itself but for self learners this is good. It&#39;s cheaper than some other big names in this space but more expensive than others. If you&#39;re not sure if you want to jump into UX/UI yet, my suggestion would be to try a cheaper course or do a preliminary course first for like $50. You&#39;ll still need to self teach yourself but at least you&#39;re only spending $50 to get an idea. I believe any course you take, you&#39;re only going to get out of it what you put into it. It&#39;s going to require work. So find one that fits your budget. I hope this helps somebody make a decision.</p>",3/1/2023,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

297548,2023.0,False,Springboard is great if you make it great!,"<p>If you are considering a bootcamp as your path into UX here is what I would take into consideration. What is your learning style? What sort of support do you need? How much time can you realistically commit to your course? Why do you want to transition into UX? How does your previous job (or school) experience relate to UX? As far as learning style goes you need to be able to self teach and pace. The curriculum is set up where you work independently for a week on reading articles watching videos and acquring knowledge that way and then applying it to the best of your ability in the form of a deliverable or project. You have access to their student community and their network of hiring professionals and most importantly you have a 30 minute meeting with a mentor once a week. For me meeting with my mentor was the most important factor. My mentor was absolutely amazing, he pushed me to be the best that I could be in this course and I am so appreciative of that. It is important that you have a mentor that suits you. Do not be afraid to request a different mentor if you are not getting what you need. That being said the sooner you do this the better. As far as support my mentor was really all I felt I needed but there are plenty of ways to get more support and in my experience any of the career coaches and hiring professionals and even senior level UX designers that you have access to throughout the course are very helpful and responsive. TIME... How much time can you realistically spend on this course is a big question you should ask yourself upfront. If your job or outside school work is very demanding this also requires a significant amount of time attention and care. You cannot expect to skip and BS your way through this program. I recommend putting time on your calendar that you intend to dedicate to the course. This could help you stay focused and finish on time. If you only want to transition into UX for the money this course will likely be quite difficult or cumbersome to you. UX is a very empathetic creative and thoughtful field. You will need the passion behind your why to really push you through when you are having a hard time or feeling unsure. Also there is no magic besides hard work that will get you a 6 figure job at the end of it. So you will get out of this exactly the work you put into it. If you want a 6 figure job work like a 6 figure worker at this. Start thinking now about how your current experience and background relates to UX. Did you work in sales or customer service? A background in Psychology? The skills you have gained in your previous experience are not for nothing using them to your advantage and being trying to leverage what you already know. Eventually, you will have a story that is your resume and your elevator pitch and many other ways to express to someone why it is you are transitioning or moving into UX and what you can bring to the table.</p>",2/3/2023,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

I&#39;m really glad I decided to go with Springboard. The curriculum was comprehensive, if not a bit outdated, but mostly covered all of the important bases and provided practice. My mentor is really what made my money worth it, because each week he gave me advice and critiqued my work, and was always available by email. My first mentor wasn&#39;t a good match, but once I was rematched, I really got a lot from that experience. The IDP (industry design project) was also a really cool way to put my knowledge and skills to the test. Overall, I think this program is a great value, a little cheaper than the main competitor, and much much higher value than most of the cheaper options.</p>",1/5/2023,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

296210,2022.0,False,A great program with a few drawbacks depending on what you are looking for.,"<p>I did a lot of research on UX Design bootcamps prior to choosing Springboard. I narrowed it down to either Springboard, General Assembly or Career Foundry in the end, but Springboard won out due to the flexible self-paced learning model, industry client project and the mentorship program. The job guarantee and career coaching was just an added bonus. My mentor experience ended up being top-notch and incredibly helpful. I feel like we were well-matched by personality and teaching/learning style, which really helped me while learning. The self-paced model is article-based course material and assignments/projects that you work through on your own and by your own schedule, depending on how quickly you want to finish the program. It&#39;s important to note that there is a max time limit on the program however, so you do have to put in a decent amount of time per week. I put in roughly 20-40 hours a week myself, sometimes more. While it&#39;s possible to complete the program in 6-9 months, I feel that 9-12 months is honestly more realistic. I felt that I could complete the program in under 9 months, so I went the monthly payment option and I regret that choice. It took me 1 year, which meant that I ended up paying more for the program than if I had pay up front. However, I will also say that I feel more prepared and confident by having taken longer with my projects and with a stronger portfolio to show for it. The industry client project was also a great experience for me. They work hard to match you well to your client and the experience was very enlightening for me. The only con for me on the industry project is that I didn&#39;t feel well prepared for when I needed to apply for it. They start every two weeks and you have to give them a good two weeks heads up that you are ready (since the program is self-paced), but if you miss your window it can really cause you to scramble with your program end date. Not a big deal if you pay upfront for the whole program though, instead of going month-to-month like I did. Overall, the Springboard UX/UI Career Track program is really top-notch, with a few drawbacks here and there depending on what you are looking for.</p>",12/27/2022,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

My motivation was to learn Python (I&rsquo;m an R user) and get guidance from a mentor (I mostly work alone) to become an overall better data scientist I understand you can find/learn the material on your own, but Springboard has it all organized and laid out cleanly here. I always knew I could learn Python but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out the best way to do it. The combination of the guided capstones and the Datacamp exercises gave me the framework to fly on my own. I also love how the course is more than just building models. It goes over the entire data science process, career help, and mentorship. I feel that I am much more well-rounded as a data scientist. My only issue was with the mentorship. I actually did the preliminary data science course and had a great mentor I really connected with on a personal level. Someone I would get a drink with. Though my mentor this course was knowledgeable and helped me enough, the relationship felt minimal and transactional. I regret not being more adamant in changing mentors because apparently it&rsquo;s an easy process. The last thing I&rsquo;ll mention is that this course is an investment. Both in terms of money and time. It cost a lot and I had spent most of my personal time working on it (I definitely rushed it a bit). I would suggest it unless you are VERY serious about becoming a data scientist or improving as one.

Mentor meetings occur once a week, and my mentor gave me feedback on my four projects, job advice, my portfolio, and more. I honestly don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be without a mentor. In addition, we had career coach calls with recruiters in the tech industry that were really educational as well. I feel more of these could have been beneficial for us, but I also haven&rsquo;t experienced any of the post-completion coach calls, which are every two weeks to report how the job search and networking is going, and to get tips/feedback. It seems like the program genuinely cares about us even post-certification, rather than just sending us off in the discouraging-at-times job search. I haven&rsquo;t experienced the job guarantee &ldquo;rules&rdquo; yet, but there are a few parameters (which seem reasonable to me) to follow in order for the job guarantee to apply. I also really benefitted from the mock interviews. I feel I got a good general idea of what to expect. They were realistic and I genuinely can&rsquo;t imagine finishing a UX bootcamp without knowing how the interviews run (including whiteboard challenges). Finding a program that was self-paced was important to me for two reasons: the first being that I was in a different timezone, so online live classes to attend was not realistic for me. Second, I found other bootcamps that were just 4 months. While that may be advantageous for those who are rushing to get a job, I didn&rsquo;t want to rush my projects and portfolio creation. Since this was my first time learning about UX, I wanted to soak all the learning in without rushing too much. And I&rsquo;m so glad I did. It&rsquo;s a lot harder than people think to discipline yourself to complete the course with a goal in mind (eg: I wanted to finish in 6 months, as I didn&rsquo;t have a full-time job and could devote all my time to the course, but instead it took +/- 12 months!) Another plus was that articles we had to read were mostly written by professionals in the field AND written with personality, vs a textbook reading. It made learning much more enjoyable and kept us in the current trends of design. Again, I can&rsquo;t speak on how my post-completion experience as I&rsquo;m just beginning, but I can&rsquo;t imagine it being really negative thanks to Springboard&rsquo;s support.</p>",10/10/2022,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

After researching numerous bootcamps, I was so hesitant about the price but felt SB had the most to offer. I can say it was worth every penny. I would recommend to complete the course slowly in order to soak in the material and capitalize on all the resources the course offers. I wasn&#39;t sure how I&#39;d feel after graduation, but I can say I feel confident and prepared going into applying for jobs. The career coaches and mentors are really unmatched, they have such a passion for helping students break into the industry and are so knowledgable with many aspects of the career transition. The best part of the course was the industry design project where you are placed on a real company to complete a project. I&#39;m so thankful for SB because now I am officially interning with the startup company that I was placed on. If you are in between choosing a bootcamp - go with Springboard.

They also provide significant career coaching which really helps with finding great jobs and getting interviews. In my opinion, the most valuable part is the mentorship. Springboard assigns a mentor that you meet with on a weekly basis. My mentor is fantastic and helped me to get a job with his company. The training is self-paced and all remote, so I was able to complete most of it while traveling the country in my RV. The program is a bit expensive compared to some others, but all the benefits are definitely worth the cost especially considering that they will give you your money back if you don&#39;t get a job offer in the Data Science field.

293235,2022.0,False,Springboard Data Science Review,"<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Springboard will give me a $10 amazon card for this review, but these are my honest feelings. This is a review for the Springboard Data Science Track. I started this track shortly before finishing my Master&#39;s in Physics. I was looking at various job prospects and found that data science would be the best track for me in light of my interests and skills. I think the program does prepare you well, at least from the perspective that you feel like you have some grounding in data science before you start your first job/start the job application process. The bootcamp is more of a content aggregator, i.e. much of the content is pulled online or obtained for free. There are a few things that might possibly make it worth the money. 1. They have a high-level understanding of what the necessary skills are, and how well versed you need to be in them. If you are like me, you find a lot of the advice online unhelpful: starting your job search by slogging through a 500-page book on the statistical theory behind machine learning models is probably not going to be that helpful. Therefore, having a guided hand through the learning process can be very valuable. 2. They set you up with a mentor. I initially had mentor problems, but eventually I was set up with a mentor who worked great with me. The mentor can both give you encouragement and direction. Talking with them will help you &quot;speak the language&quot; so that you can communicate well during interviews. Finally, they know what projects will help you stand out/be helpful for your learning. 3. They push you to setup a LinkedIn and push the job application process strongly in general. For someone who only ever did research in university, the prospect of making a LinkedIn, making a resume to send to companies, and showing up to interviews was an intimidating and opaque process (silly in retrospect, I know). Springboard will push you to get it all done. Obviously, the program is not perfect. The program is expensive, and results will vary by typical factors like motivation, talent, and plain old luck. My analysis of the community is that there is a group of people who struggle with the material, and, much more importantly, struggle to get the first job (I have no stats on this population, but they are very visible). This also contributes to the general atmosphere of uncertainty and desperation that, as you might imagine, plagues your cohort as they are scrambling to find jobs. Please take keep in mind that the program will not work by magic (finishing the program is not enough) and examine critically whether you fit the &quot;target&quot; of a new data scientist. That being said, I did land an amazing job shortly before finishing the program, well beyond my expectations! Given that, I can only criticize the program so harshly, as I see the final result of the program as being extremely good! Overall, Springboard worked extremely well for me, so I would give it a hearty (but cautious) recommendation.</p>",9/22/2022,,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

One-on-one mentoring was one of the most important features for me. I was matched with a mentor that I met with weekly (virtually) who reviewed all of my work, answered questions, made corrections and suggestions, as well as pointed me to additional resources, and guided me on my path. In addition to my personal mentor&rsquo;s code reviews and instruction, I was given the opportunity to have other mentors give me code reviews of some of the larger curriculum projects which were valuable for getting additional perspectives and becoming comfortable with code reviews in general. The video lectures are put together well and come with study notes. There are many project assignments that are thoughtfully put together and challenging. The capstone projects have become features in my portfolio. There is a series of mock interviews that you prepare for and must pass that is an invaluable experience: Behavioral, Project code walk-through, Technical, and whiteboard. This process is very helpful to the interview process The career services and support are top-notch. Throughout the course, there are career modules to work on so that upon graduation the student is ready to begin the job search that includes resume and cover letter building, networking, and LinkedIn optimization. Post graduation you work with a career coach for 6 months (with available free extensions) to guide you on your job search, prepare you for behavioral interviews, teach you to use the many online resources available, help with job offer negotiations, etc. There is a job guarantee which offers tuition reimbursement if a job is not secured in 6 months and the graduate stays compliant with standards of job search requirements.</p>",9/6/2022,Software Engineering Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

I had always felt confident to google such subjects when I needed to get a one-off job done, but I was well aware that my work was likely rife with hidden inefficiencies, tacky stylistic choices, and affronts to established convention. The problem with that kind of learning is that you &quot;don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know&quot;.

I can say that Springboard did pay off in that respect. I feel confident to not just speak about those elements of tech, but I know the pros and cons of each of them. Because you get experience with multiple Capstone projects that are indicative of industry assignmemts, I also feel confident with my skills in execution while using any of these technologies - despite having zero experience in many of them prior to Springboard.

Between the weekly mentor calls, career coach calls, and on-demand mentor calls, I think it was pretty easy getting the help I needed. I personally have difficulties with deadlines and holding myself accountable at times, however my mentor was pretty good at trying to help me with that. I also really enjoyed hearing about my mentor&#39;s and my career coaches&#39; work experiences over the years.

291540,2022.0,False,Springboard User Experience Design Career Track Was a Positive Experience,"<p>I took Springboard&#39;s UX Design Career Track from October 2021 through March 2022. I took it as a way to accelerate my career transition and be prepared to start a career in UX. There are plenty of bootcamps to choose from I&#39;ll highlight why I chose this particular camp over the others. Why I chose Springboard The features that were most attractive to me were the mentorship with someone who has been in industry for a long time, the career coaching, a legitimate job guarantee clause, and the ability to self pace. Another very important feature was the curriculum of course, as it was something that gave me the accurate information in an industry with a lot of misinformation circulating. Mentorship It is important to have mentorship, as a good experienced designer&#39;s expertise empowered me to know I was achieving real success in my work throughout the course as all assignments were graded and reviewed. I also loved the weekly meetings with my mentor to discuss my work and any questions. Career Coaching Before the course I never had a good picture of how to network, job search or interview effectively. This was all covered and explained in the course and it was great to give me increased confidence in job search, which I always found intimidating before. Job Guarantee I did not need to use the job guarantee, as I got a job before the time period ended. I did review it and find it acceptable, especially because their requirements were designed to increase your chances of getting a job. You&#39;re required to continue building your network and required to apply to jobs. If you are a chrome user there is an extension that makes submitting the connections and job applications easy enough that it doesn&#39;t add too much work in addition to the job search its self. Self Paced I did this course while working a full time job, and it was quite a full schedule. The ability to time things on my own within the total course time requirement made me able to get ahead some weeks and have slack weeks when I simply didn&#39;t have time or availability. A Couple Challenges It&#39;s important to require excellence from yourself in your work. If you really want to do UX Design put your back into your work, as it doesn&#39;t do its self. While this may seem like a non-statement, I want to point out that for a junior role there are often HUNDEREDS of applicants. This level of competition requires working hard to get things done. A second challenge is there is little education in the course for quantitative data gathering, which is very important in the actual field. A third challenge is I found out that they expect the course to take 8 months rather than the advertised 6. I don&#39;t appreciate the bait and switch feeling this gave me. That being said I put my back into it and almost completed it in 6 months. Springboard is not perfect, but it had what I needed to learn and make my career transition!</p>",8/6/2022,UX Career Track,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
291404,2022.0,False,Fantastic Course,"<p>Excellent syllabus, very much complete! High quality videos from a high quality instructor, Colt Steele taking you step by step from 0 to 100 in each unit. I would say that Colt and my Mentor were my major motivators during this journey. My mentor was an industry expert, with very deep knowledge in full stack development and always eager to assist me when needed. I also enjoyed the flexibility I had with this online course to follow my own pace without ever feeling struggling alone out there. Teaching assistants, &quot;on-demand mentors&quot; and peers community on slack were available at any time. However, I have to mention that the material to cover is endless and additionally there are various optional units that I found necessary to study. This means that in order to finish and get the maximum, the student needs to be very well organised and self-motivated. Otherwise it might take much more time than anticipated.

291305,2022.0,False,Great for Career Pivot,"<p>I am a teacher transitioning to data analytics. I chose Springboard&#39;s Data Analyst track because I wanted to pivot quickly. I chose the program because 1. I knew I wanted something paced with curriculum provided (I didn&#39;t want to have to figure what I needed to know and then figure out where to learn it) and 2. I wanted something that was career track focused. I wanted to pivot from teaching to Data Analyst and the job guarantee sold me. They also provide more data if you request like completion rates. Other bootcamps did not provide this. I&#39;m satisfied with my experience, and I feel prepared to enter the data analytics profession. Cons: -&gt;HOWEVER, I am not yet employed as a data analyst. So, I can&#39;t say yet if my investment paid off! Hopefully I will never have to say if they will make good on their job guarantee. I completed the program about 1 week ago, it&#39;s too soon to say on this subject. -&gt;About 1/2 the curriculum is sourced from other websites &amp; Youtube. As a professional educator, this DOES NOT bother me. Like any teacher will tell you, if someone else made a kick ass lesson plan there is no reason to re-create it, just use it! (It is not stolen content, Springboard either pays for you to use it or it is already free, and they give credit to source) Tips: Take the free Excel course they offer to see how it feels. That is a good indicator if the pacing and style will work for you. Go into this knowing that YOU are the deciding factor on success. That means YOU have to want to do this work, YOU have to make the connections with the mentor and fellows, YOU have to practice daily. They give you the tools, but YOU have to use them. The career coaches are amazing, USE THEIR SERVICES! Take every tip they give you even if they are sometimes harsh or it feels like you don&#39;t need help with the soft skills, just do it anyway! Believe me, I am/was a teacher, my communication skills are 10/10 but after a practice interview and feedback my confidence and interview skills are now 12/10 lol Lastly, don&#39;t be discouraged. I don&#39;t have a math background, but I learned statistics. Am I the best? NO. Did I get it in 2 weeks? NO. But did I learn it? YES!

291205,2022.0,True,Great bootcamp for Data Analytics,<p>Joined the Springboard Data Analytics Career track back in Jan 2022. I am not from analytics background and I had a good experience overall. Some of the pros and con are below. Pros- 1. The skills taught were relevant to the industry and provided me with additional confidence. 2. The curriculum was solid and covered a lot great topics. 3. The mentor and career coach are great and important part of the bootcamp. Cons 1. Can be more economical and felt it to be on expensive side. 2. Can provide more information on how to best use the time with industry mentors and extract maximum value. Overall I would definitely recommend this bootcamp for someone looking to transition into Data Analytics career. I did my google data analytics certification before starting this bootcamp which helped me as well and would recommend doing any kind of basic certification or courses of the tools which would be used in the bootcamp before hand to help you not get overwhelmed during the whole process and make it smoother.</p>,7/28/2022,Data Analytics Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

290917,2022.0,True,Springboard was fulfilling,"<p>I had a pretty fulfilling experience with Springboard. At first, I was assigned an unprofessional mentor who rarely showed up, and when the mentor did, it was 20 mins late and our call would last 5 minutes. This lasted for a month and as a result - i learned incorrectly. This was a HUGE bummer, especially because I was paying $1,300 a month for stellar mentorship. I was paired with a new one who was great, but eventually ended up leaving months later due to a massive pay cut. My third, and last, mentor was absolutely fantastic. I truly wish i had been assigned her from the start. She was patient with me while also challenging and holding me accountable. I relearned missed concepts from my first mentor. I realized I hadn&#39;t come up with the strongest solutions for my 2 capstones so I went back and my mentor was proud and cheered me on the whole way. I wished i would&#39;ve had my mentor from the beginning, she truly made the experience amazing. Regarding content, i&#39;d say cirruculum is good, but you can really learn it all on your own. i personally love how its laid out, its a better set up for me personally. just know that most of the material is Medium articles. The career support is awesome and i&#39;m really excited to utilize it more. i do wish it was more of a requirement to meet with career coaches throughout the program.</p>",7/20/2022,UI/UX Design Career Track,3.7,[],4.0,4.0,3.0,springboard
290899,2022.0,False,Great data science program at an affordable cost,"<p>If you are looking for a self-paced online study program for data science at an affordable cost, Springboard is the right pick for you! Springboard&#39;s 500+ hour online self-paced technical curriculum leans heavily on a combination of DataCamp coursework, online articles, and self-created exercises and materials to teach students the necessary skills to be a data science professional. Their technical coursework is supplemented by additional career and technical resources, including regular call opportunities with an industry expert to assist you in your projects and a career coaching team ready to help you dress up your resume and experience and tackle your job hunt. However, because there are no deadlines in this course (except for the 6-mo Course-End date) you really have to stay on top of yourself. There are no mechanisms built into the coursework for advisors or mentors to track your progress and help push you along, if needed, so you, like I, may find yourself getting behind on the material and ending up at risk of not completing by Course-End and losing access to the course without certification. But, if you are good at pacing yourself and staying committed over a long timeline, you will find Springboard is quite accommodating and flexible. They boast a &#39;mentorship&#39; program, with weekly 1:1 calls with an industry expert that I found to more closely resembles a one-way &#39;human Google&#39; relationship than a proper mentor relationship. The burden of creating value from the calls falls entirely on the student and the &#39;mentor&#39; does not bring anything to the table. While they do a very good job of providing feedback and advise on specific questions and topics, when prompted, I feel like their mentor program could be so much better if the &#39;mentors&#39; actually mentored the students actively. That said, they cultivate a nice community amongst the students via their Slack channels and weekly &#39;fireside discussions&#39; where are optional live &#39;lectures&#39; around some relevant topic. I found the Slack community to be quite helpful in guiding me through many obstacles I encountered, particularly a small group of student alums which frequent the channels and are eager to help. I also found the Career services and learning units to be very helpful and it changed my perspective on how to market myself and my skills to be more successful in my career. I anticipate using these resources and knowledge I gained there to help me in my career well beyond my &#39;first data science job&#39;. I found Springboard&#39;s cost to be cheaper than most competitors and their job guarantee was a nice hook, and you get what you pay for. There&#39;s no live lectures or other resource that simulates a &#39;classroom&#39; environment, and some of the materials are a bit outdated, but considering everything above, I think the value is very good overall.</p>",7/20/2022,Data Science Career Track,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,springboard
290804,2022.0,True,A well-organized curriculum,"<p>The Springboard UX career Bootcamp was a memorable experience for me. I enrolled in the career track in November and got certification about 2 weeks ago. I had a blast on this journey. My mentor was super supportive and always there when I needed her when I needed help. I found that the 1:1 session with Weekly was so helpful and even though she was off her schedule, she was answering my questions via email and Slack. Like an internship, Springboard provides industry projects after I finish my capstone project. It was such an amazing experience and one that I will never forget. This experience gave me a sense of what I will be doing when I become a real UX designer in the near future. I am so pleased with my springboard experience.

290796,2022.0,True,Ultimately effective in its goal - always room to improve!,"<p>I started from basically zero skill in programming languages. I studied python on my own for about 3-4 months before I joined springboard. Initially, it was heavy on using Datacamp lessons to teach you the fundamentals, but pretty soon you dove in to doing projects. It was pretty heavy at first to try to do even a &#39;guided&#39; project, and the mentors are not there to give you the answers or grade your work (which is good!), but to give you overall guidance on your progress and ideas. It was bit difficult to take full advantage of the mentor meetings because you cant have good questions when you dont know what you dont know. The structure and the content was effective and relevant. I definitely could not have done this on my own. The projects and the experience directly helped me get a job dong analytics, which was my goal. The skills came in handy during the job&#39;s case study and during the interview process. I found a job at about the 40% mark in the course progress. I did not use the job support much, I only had one meeting with the career coach. The career coach tips and lessons in the curriculum did help, but the skills were definitely more important to me personally.</p>",7/18/2022,Data Science Career Track,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,springboard
290775,2022.0,False,Springboard UX bootcamp,"<p>I&#39;ll try to not repeat what everyone else has said but here is my take INDUSTRY PROVEN my 2 previous coworkers at Meta took this course and recommended it to me, so it is not a scam. PRO - good curriculum (public sources) covering all the important details of UX - good program QA, a lot of the assignments are reviewed and checked so it is not a pay to pass course - good community and students, very positive experience working mentors and students - real Industry project - you will learn how to work with fellow students and an actual live client. I would temper your experiences and expect an up and down experience just like freelance. The point is to gain knowledge and you may not come out with the perfect project you wanted - professional resources, they will shape your LinkedIn and resumes to be top notch, confirmed - 6 months post graduate job support, you are on a strict schedule but it is to ensure you are being serious about applying and finding a UX job - great mentors from actual US companies, you will find actual professionals who will tell you what it is really like and what to do. This is the best part of the program - great customer service , they do get back to you and try to address your concerns. I had to re-match mentors and Industry projects and Springboard did a great job crediting me and ensuring a smooth transition CONS - cost, it is high so if you are self driven conceivably you could do maybe 50%+ yourself and freelance to cover the rest. Your milage may vary - matchups be a mix and match, you may not get the right mentor or industry project, so be prepared for some frustration or ask to re-match and this time will be compensated from your billing. It doesn&#39;t mean your mentor or industry cleint is &quot;bad&quot; - it just might not be your fit. Everyone here is professional and very qualified from my experience interacting with them. - imperfections, this course isn&#39;t perfect and this is student work so I wouldn&#39;t expect these to be amazing unique portfolio pieces unless you spend time to elevate the UI production or nail a perfect interview script - how much you put into it matches how much you get out of it. Springboard is merely the mechanism to help you get there Is it for you? I can&#39;t answer that but you do get what you pay for, mostly. The rest you&#39;ll have to learn on your own or nudge Springboard a bit if you feel you&#39;re not getting what you promised in terms of support.

Here are the pros and cons of my experience with Springboard: ---PROS -Colt Steele presents all the instruction materials (via recorded video). He does a great job and was super easy to follow along with. It was pretty rare that I would complete a video and not understand the concepts he had presented. -I found the Career Services very impressive. The career coaches are really high-caliber individuals in the field of job searching, recruiting, resume building, etc. Very, very helpful. They even made themselves available to me outside of the allotted career calls. -The mentors are also a great resource. My mentor was very easy to get ahold of and a highly-skilled programmer who was able to show me lots of little details that the curriculum would not have had the time to get into. He is actively involved in the industry right now so he is able to translate &quot;classroom&quot; material into how it works in the real world. -Obviously I don&#39;t have experience with other bootcamps to compare, but I think the price of Springboard is very, very reasonable. The assignments (which may be the most important part of any program) were appropriately challenging. Most of them required going beyond what was explicitly taught in the lesson and forced you to go deeper (in a good way). ---CONS -In my humble opinion, I think the curriculum spends a little too much time on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). From what I understand, this model is beginning to be replaced by more functional programming. I also think React should be introduced much earlier. That seems to be the most prominent front-end framework right now, so it would be beneficial to learn that sooner rather than &quot;mastering&quot; traditional vanilla JavaScript. -There were times where the Springboard site was a little bit glitchy, but it was never so much of an issue that it prevented me from working for much time.

If you would like to skip all reading and know the final verdict then -&gt; it&#39;s a waste of money/time/effort. They will promise you everything in the beginning and hide the most important information. Then, will give you magical statistic numbers of their success during many years, but in the reality, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. If you failed to get the job before, there is a 99.999% chance you will fail after. Please do careful research before the final decision to join them. Look at their alumni and how much time they spend to land that first job. Do not listen to what they say. It is just marketing to get people like us (desperate for hope) to get on board and get our money. For those who want more information. Going a little dipper. The curriculum is outdated. A lot of mistakes/bugs. No one is willing to fix them even if you will spend your time reporting. Mentorship is a joke. Still, there is a smaaaaaall chance you could get a good one, but probably I was the unluckiest one. It was always not enough time to ask all relevant questions and get the answers. At the end of the Bootcamp, you are on your own to get that first job. People, please be aware that YOU CAN NOT GET THE JOB not because you do not have the right knowledge/skills but WORK-FIELD EXPERIENCE. Most companies do not give a sh... about your skills/certificates and other things as long as you could prove that you worked and applied that knowledge on a daily basis. Work experience is a key to your success. This Bootcamp IS NOT considered to be work experience. Do not be confused with that. Companies will be looking at you as a lier if you will put this resume as work experience (my own experience). So, be realistic to yourselves, and find a way to get a job.

The flow and the structure of learning core technologies and frameworks and libraries helped me understand not only high level but also what is going on behind the scene when the coding is rendered, that allowed me to think more logically while debugging and applying my own ideas in the projects.</p>",7/3/2022,Software Engineering Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

So all-in-all it was great for those resources. I would&#39;ve like to see some live instructor-led classes maybe once a week or something to learn from some real professionals at the school.

I recommend the program without reservation (except, make time for it and plan &ndash; it is real work).

As I was taking the course, I got promoted internally to an Accounts Receivable Clerk, which I was very pleased with. I directly used the skills I learned from Springboard to leverage myself for a new role within my company. The core strengths and key takeaways I gained from this course was a new approach to structured thinking, a deeper understanding of the importance of networking, and the confidence to become a constant self-learner. Before this course, I had no idea where to begin as a budding data analyst. I had no clue what skills I needed to learn or what those technical skills even did. But, after finishing this course, I now have a clear understanding of what a data analyst does, what the tools of a data analyst are, and what the tools do. Also, now I know how to approach networking with people. Through this course, I gained the confidence I needed to reach out to people for networking, for jobs, for advice, and for help/mentorship. Lastly, Springboard&#39;s Data Analytics Career Track program excels due to it&#39;s large community of support. Through others in your cohort or through Springboard&#39;s large panel of career coaches and mentors, they provide a great source of mental, emotional, and technical support you may need to help you successfully transition into a career as a data analyst.

Springboard assigns a mentor that you meet with on a weekly basis. My mentor is fantastic and helped me to get a job with his company. The training is self-paced and all remote, so I was able to complete most of it while traveling the country in my RV.

289351,2022.0,False,SpringBoard Software Engineering Career Track Prep,"<p>Overall my experience was very positive during the Software Engineering Career Track Prep at Springboard. They offer weekly mentor calls, a community on Slack where you actually do get responses if you post a question, and lessons broken up in a structured manner. The lessons typically consist of downloading the code that is used during the instructional videos as well as what is covered in the video presentations, a handful of videos by Colt Steele, and exercises at the end of each lesson. There was only one lesson in the whole course I felt that the exercises did not align well with what was covered in the videos. At the very end, they provide plenty of practice questions for the Technical Skills Survey (TSS) that were extremely helpful. The videos are entertaining, easy to follow, and were not a waste of time, so they were way better than other coding tutorial videos I&#39;ve watched in the past. Although HTML and CSS were part of the course, Javascript was really the only one that mattered as far as taking the TSS goes. However, even with the given resources, the TSS was not easy. It did still require me to go out and do additional studying outside of Springboard, seek help from my mentor, and seek help in the Springboard Slack community. The Slack community and mentor were both great resources when I ran into a problem I couldn&#39;t solve on my own. I&#39;d recommend this prep course for anyone wanting to pursue a software career and needing a place to start, I&#39;d just put the disclaimer that it will require a lot of time and looking things up on your own if you have no previous coding experience at all. It is not meant to get your career going right off the bat, only to get you into the main Software Engineering Career Track Springboard offers.

The bulk of the course is video based instruction taught by Colt Steele. Colt&rsquo;s instructions are easily digestible, although he does fail to provide adequate mistakes in his instruction to provide practice on how to find and fix bugs. The TA team does a great job of filling this gap. There is a weekly meeting with a mentor, but 30 minutes sometimes is not adequate to explain, debug, conceptualize and plan for the next week. The largest downfall is in the community. Although it is improving, YMMV when it comes to your particular cohort. Because the course is self paced, your cohort will be progress through the course at varying speeds. This makes it difficult to schedule study groups or coordinate on specific topics. The career services team is good, but there is no defined consensus as to what Springboard defines as to the correct way to create a resume, cover letter or LinkedIn. If you stick with one career counselor throughout the entire course, you will have a better experience than bouncing around. I recommend Springboard to aspiring developers as long as they get the correct mentor and career counselor early on in the course.

There were also good things as well &ndash; a new job after losing my previous one to Covid, but this did cut into my ability to study and focus on my school work after working on a computer all day at work. I was emotionally and technically drained at times. I had to switch mentors in the midst of my program due to these breaks and was definitely feeling like I may not finish the course. Springboard&rsquo;s advisor and mentor programs kept me chatting with their support teams and kept me motivated to finish for myself and my future. I was able to absorb knowledge on a timeframe that made sense for my learning capabilities. I feel as a springboard really allows its students to take the time they need in order to grasp the knowledge they&rsquo;re sharing and that&rsquo;s why I really recommend springboard. In a world with so many ups and downs and unknowns at this point, I always felt comfortable reaching out to spring forward for support. The course itself brings on a lot of reading, but the structure is really well thought out so that you can learn different phases of research and designing at a time that makes sense. Lastly, the mentor meetings on a weekly basis help me stay on track and brew really important for my progression in the course.</p>",4/25/2022,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Many of my friends went to General assembly but they couldn&#39;t make a sold portfolio because they were so busy with their schedules. Also, GA doesn&#39;t require you to finish up the portfolio when you finish the course. On the other hand, Springboard cares for you from making a solid portfolio until you get a job. When you are assigned Springbboad they match you with a mentor in the real industry. But I don&#39;t care about that. However, career coaches are so genuine and care so much for what you need. I thought Springboard was expensive, but it was worth it. If you are thinking about choosing a technical BootCamp.

From the simple design spruce ups to full-scale capstones, you perform every level of the design process in order to understand every aspect back to front. While there are some lessons that do go on a little long (i.e. lots of articles that simply repeat the same information) or slightly outdated articles, the essence of what you&#39;re learning remains the same.

287669,2022.0,True,"Career coaching, mentoring, data analysis and machine learning","<p>It was a correct decision to learn at the Data Science Career Track program at Springboard, as I finally started getting responses from employers. On one of the applications I was one step away from employment. This course helps boost your chances and compete with those who has formal specialized education, such as in computer science or data science. While a lack of formal experience through employment is still a problem, it is somewhat alleviated by the hands-on curriculum projects and the projects done after completing the course. In my feeling, completing this course gives you a credibility. There are three main components: career coaching by people experienced in technical recruiting, mentorship by data scientists working in industry, and well organized tutorial materials. In my opinion, it would be very hard for a self-learner to achieve such pace and quality of learning. Having to pay disciplines and ensures a good pace of learning. Not everyone gets a good mentor. My two advices here are: 1) change the mentor if he behaves like he is your boss and only demands, and you need to spend a lot of time just to think what questions are good and bad. This could be OK only in the beginning. 2) Stick to the one who is genuinely willing to help. Springboard allows to switch to another mentor, they have some long-term selection in place. Most career coaches are very helpful, you can meet with them roughly every week. Here my suggestion is to stay organized: write their suggestions and execute on the same day, because otherwise you will find it difficult to get back to it due to a lot of main technical learning which keeps piling up if you are not as organized. Make sure to agree with your family members: they will miss you a lot 6 to 9 months, because they will mostly see your back while you are sitting at the computer. The skills you get are worth it, but there is still a long job search ahead after graduation in most cases. Delve deeply into material, as there are four mock up interviews close to the end of the course. The best ways to prepare for Data Science course is to learn Python, Statistics, and SQL in advance, and try to craft a resume and LinkedIn profile. At the end, you learn how to extend your network, data analysis, and machine learning. Only basic familiarity with statistics and SQL, but there are many resources in the curriculum, which you can use for training, including after graduation. No exposure to cloud techniques, but you will become prepared to play with those on your own. Up to two breaks are allowed, up to 3 weeks each, which helps make it in time if you like to delve deeper or have a lack of prior experience.</p>",4/13/2022,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Through the projects and group Industry Design Project, I was really able to apply all of the learnings in the course. I will say it would be nice for Springboard to add more emphasis on how to set metrics to measure in our projects early on, and possibly a unit on how to develop products that are not just user-focused, but also take into account how to incorporate business goals while creating a user-centric product. Overall, I am happy I took this course and learned lots through the process - especially because of my mentor. I learned so much because of being connected with someone in the industry who could provide direct feedback on all my works. Springboard&#39;s career coaches are quite helpful too, I learned so much about job hunting that I wasn&#39;t taught in university. I am eager to apply those techniques in my job search and am optimistic in landing a job in this field now.

I am a biologist and absolutely did not had any experience in data science. I took the Data Science prep course first, which taught me python programming in just 4 weeks. Then I enrolled on the Data Science Career Track. The course is expected to be completed in 6-9 months, so one has to be ready to invest at least 4 hours of time every day in learning. The best thing about the course is it teaches the entire curriculum using public resources, which include DataCamp, LinkedIn, Youtube, Harvard lessons and other useful public forums. This is great because you know after the course completion where to continue your learning and find resources related to a specific subject. Every unit has a number of mini-projects to practice that increase your confidence in your learning. 1 to 1 mentor calls every week is a great benefit, as you will be interacting with an industry expert to review your projects and they will help you to streamline your learning and choose a better career path. At the end of the course, you will be proficient in python programming, mastered in essential statistical concepts and you can independently work on data science projects.

I just recently completed Springboard&rsquo;s Data Science Career Track certification program, and here are my pros and cons. Pros: - Being paired with an expert mentor for the entire duration of the course is incredibly helpful. My mentor pushed me to go deeper beyond the curriculum and helped my projects really shine. - This is my preference, but I appreciate the self-paced online nature of the program, as opposed to live lectures. There are numerous case studies throughout the program that give you a guided opportunity to practice what you just learned, which is really helpful. - The two required capstone projects are great for your portfolio, and really help you see the data science life cycle from end to end. Cons: - The statistics curriculum is really lacking. Having no background in statistics, I found it hard to keep up with as they covered difficult topics superficially with speed. Part of the statistics curriculum is reading a book called &ldquo;The Art of Statistics&rdquo;. Unless you have prior background in statistics, this book is not easy to understand. - The program does its best to cover many common machine learning algorithms, but they don&rsquo;t really go into detail on how the algorithms work. You&rsquo;ll watch some pre-recorded online lectures from Harvard, but it&rsquo;s hard to learn from a one-off lecture without really building the fundamentals of how basic algorithms work. I am just beginning my job search, so I cannot speak to the quality of the job support. From what I understand, you meet with a career coach biweekly to help you with your job search. To qualify for the job guarantee, you need to apply to 4 jobs per week and make 7 networking connections per week and do 2 informational interviews per month. They definitely emphasize networking as the main way to get your first job, as opposed to cold applications. All in all, I definitely learned a lot from this program. If you are an independent learner and are OK with taking additional courses on statistics and ML after completion, I would definitely recommend this program.</p>",3/22/2022,Data Science Career Track,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Once I vetted Springboard&#39;s job guarantee, it was a no-brainer to sign up. At the time of this writing (March 2022) I had an option to pay only after I received a qualifying position, or else I wouldn&#39;t have to pay at all. The curriculum is outstanding for the small timeframe that it&#39;s delivered in. My only wish is that it was delivered in a different format so that I could have used my phone to work on it instead of having to be at my computer for it. The mentor experience and career services are absolutely top notch for Springboard. My wife had a baby in the middle of my cohort, and Springboard allowed my to pause for a very generous amount of time with 0 repercussions to the job guarantee or completion.

The final piece is more of a very short internship with a client and a team of fellow Springboard students. The rest of the course includes a decent amount of publicly available videos and articles and is pretty much entirely self-paced without any real deadlines. Probably the best part of the course is the mentor program. You&#39;re matched with a mentor who is currently working as a UX Designer who will help guide you with a 30 minute call each week. I was fortunate enough to get a very enthusiastic mentor who gave a lot of feedback. I can&#39;t stress enough how helpful it was to have someone with real-world experiences to discuss things with. Your milage will vary based on how good you are at setting your own pace and deadlines and getting a good mentor. I will also give Springboard credit for updating the curriculum and their extremely responsive and thorough customer service. The do seem to be actively working to improve the experience (for this course at least). Of my four star rating, one of them is entirely due to that.

I work as a content operations administrator at my current company, and have collaborated with the UX team many times. I think a portion of the curriculum should have involved some form of shadowing, considering that imposter syndrome is much higher without holding undergraduate degree in UX or design. While almost all that was taught was information readily available on the web, having the support of a mentor, career coaches and a student advisor all while learning on my own time while managing my busy lifestyle was helpful.

286507,2022.0,False,UX/UI - Life Changing Experience.,"<p>When I first began looking for courses I needed to be able to do it on my own time since when I started I was working full time. I also desired to have a mentor who is currently in the field to give me tips and pointers as well as critique my work since that is invaluable as a UX/UI Designer. Springboard offered all this and more with their job guarantee and their deferred payment plans. Money was tight and the program is set up to help you make that switch. I have to pay more overall with the deferred payment plan but Springboard gives you the structure to land your dream job. Also, the increase in pay with the new job makes Springboard and easy investment. What was most helpful was the way they structured their curriculum, help me build a portfolio, mentorship, and career search strategies. Curriculum - was sectioned and split in a way that gives you the most concise information needed as well as optional content for those that want to go the extra mile and earn a bit more. I believe you also can look at the curriculum for your lifetime in case you ever need to refer back to it. They constantly update their curriculum. Portfolio - Springboard knows what companies like and the Industry Design Project (IDP) gives you hands-on experience that managers like to see. You also develop two case studies and a design sprint that showcases your skills. Mentorship - Mentorship is an invaluable resource when learning new skills. If you seek to grow you need insight from those that have been doing it longer. It gives you an edge up over other people that are gunning for the same job because you are partnered with the very managers and leads that you will be applying to. Career - There are career coaches that help to support you in your career search as you go through the curriculum and there is a lot of good nuggets I&#39;ve received in how to network. It&#39;s uncomfortable to network but it&#39;s necessary. I gave Job Assistance a 4/5 just because springboard does everything except get you the internship or the job themselves. One thing that they can explore in the future is possibly partnering with companies in the way they do with their IDP projects but help students land paid positions. Conclusion All-in-all Springboard has changed my life. You really get out what you put in though. Many of my peers did not put in the same amount of work that I did. I was both desperate and inspired because I ended up leaving my job to pursue Springboard full time.

286457,2022.0,False,"Acceptable Coursework, Good Job Support, Great Alumni Network. Ideal course if you have a technical background.","<p>I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and 2 years of experience working as an engineer. I pursued this course full time, working approximately 30-50 hours a week towards it. I was able to complete the course with Advanced ML Specialization in 5 months. I now have a job as a Machine Learning Engineer, with a base salary that is 23% higher than my previous salary. I believe that this course is great for people who have a STEM degree and who have some technical work experience or technical project experience. If you do not have these things, I think it would be wiser to either pursue a technical degree or one of Springboard&#39;s other courses, such as their DA or DE courses. I rate the coursework three out of five stars. The structure of the coursework was immensely helpful in guiding my journey to learn the steps in the DS/ML workflow, and it kept me organized and disciplined in my studies. The early course material does a good job of explaining the basics of Python, SQL, and the DS workflow. However, the depth of the course material starts to lose its quality in the sections covering statistics, ML algorithms, and the specialization material. There are mini-projects related to the major algorithms (regression, classification, and clustering) and statistical concepts (CLT, AB tests, etc.), however, these sections sometimes skip over critical details that are commonly discussed in technical interviews (such as assumptions of linear regression). Additionally, the ML specialization did not provide projects related to the topics of deployment. Overall I would have liked to see more depth and detail in the later content. I will add that most of the content is either coursework on DataCamp or proprietary Jupyter Notebooks created by Springboard. Many of my peers agreed that the DataCamp coursework does not retain well since they are simple fill-in-the-blank exercises. The notebooks are more useful since they show practical examples of how an algorithm or concept would be applied, but overall the content has a perceived low value since the DataCamp membership can be had for a low price. The mentorship was also hit-or-miss. I was lucky to have a mentor with a background in statistics, so he was able to explain some of the advanced concepts that I really needed help with understanding. Some of my peers had mentors with backgrounds in MLE or analytics, and they were not of much use to my peers. Therefore I would say that the value of the mentor is dependent on luck. I believe that the true value of the course comes in career support, portfolio projects, and the alumni network. Springboard actually does a great job of aggregating good articles for how to pursue a career in DS, how to tailor your resume, and how to network. The career coaches are very experienced in recruiting and HR practices, so they give great advice when it comes to resume design and how to approach interviews. The course also includes mock interviews for behavioral, coding, project presentation, and general DS interviews, which are invaluable in preparing for real interviews. The portfolio projects are vital when it comes to catching the eyes of hiring managers, so I would recommend tailoring those to the companies you want to work for. Most of all, I found value in the alumni network. I was able to secure a couple of interviews easily because I reached out to Springboard alumni at companies that were hiring. I would recommend Springboard to anyone who is looking to change careers, but I would only recommend this DS course for individuals who have a technical background since companies typically look for some form of technical background for this type of role. As mentioned previously, I would recommend individuals with little to no background to pursue another path with a lower barrier to entry, such as Data Analytics or Data Engineering.</p>",3/6/2022,Data Science Career Track,4.0,[],4.0,3.0,5.0,springboard

Even more helpful and exciting were the four major projects that I completed over the course of 9 months which put my design skills to work after honing them through tutorials and mini-projects. I was able to go through the full-circle process of creating mock mobile apps and work with a client with a team of fellow Springboard students. This was the perfect way to prepare me for &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; as a designer. I came out with 4 great pieces to start building my design portfolio. The most beneficial part of the program was having weekly calls with my mentor (an experienced designer) who I developed a great relationship with. I looked forward to them every week, getting great feedback about my projects plus advice and insight about the industry. Career coach calls throughout the program definitely help you prepare for the job search, even if you have a good resume and LinkedIn from the start like I did. Springboard really solidified that a UI designer is 100% the career that I want to transition to. As the curriculum progressed, I found myself looking at apps and websites as a designer, recognizing poor user experiences and thinking of ways that they could be improved, which is exactly how you should think as a designer!

Problem, claiming that it is their policy to keep you waiting for 48 hours because they just can. Third, mentors are not on the same page when it comes to materials and content students have read in their curriculum. I often asked questions from mentor only to hear that he found them challenging! When students decide to embark on an arduous task of learning data, mentors need to patiently work with them and walk them through the steps instead of asking them to GOOGLE IT!

Each session is a buildup of the knowledge you have accumulated up to that point, then that knowledge is applied to the project/prototype that you develop. But don&#39;t worry, you have a mentor (a professional working in the field) to guide you through the process which in my case was flawless with Aleya. Another helpful resource is having your completed work reviewed by actual hiring managers. This perk will give you the feedback needed to make improvements or the confidence needed to know that you have made the right decision in your field of choice moving forward. Last but not least, you have the job guarantee option. If you pass the course and start to search for a job, they guarantee with their assistance that you will find a job or the course is free.

Here are my pros/cons of the program overall. Pros: 1. The mentorship program is amazing. The mentor I worked with through my time in the program had expert industry knowledge, was very generous, communicative, and supportive. I have nothing but amazing things to say about him. 2. There were so many options for support through the advisement team, office hours, career coaching, the student network through slack, and extra meetings with mentors. 3. You are given many opportunities to practice skills through a very project-focused curriculum. 4. The curriculum itself was well-organized, and really drilled in UX concepts and principles. 5. The option for career coaching post-graduation is very helpful as you job search. Cons: 1. Some of the information could be a bit repetitive, which can be both helpful and overwhelming in some ways. 2. I would say the time expectations of the program are not what I expected. It would be nice to see more options for people who work full-time on top of going to school. 3. I think there needs to be more flexibility to student needs when matching with the IDP.

The online course is self-paced so if you&#39;re not motivated to push through the work on your own, this part might be difficult. You get weekly mentor calls which helped keep me accountable. The cost of the course has gone up quite a bit since I enrolled (back in 2020) but I felt a lot more prepared to apply for jobs afterwards, and having a knowledgeable mentor helped me get real world expertise. The course is a well curated compilation of articles/videos, but the UI exercises were a little harder for me to connect with.

I felt like everyone who I interacted with on the Springboard team was really helpful and truly wanted me to succeed--that&#39;s a great feeling. The course material was very well put together. Mostly curated articles and videos for you to read, but it was great to have that direction so that I could further supplement what I had learned with other youtube videos or articles. You get 2 capstone projects, 1 design sprint, and an IDP which is a real world project. Going through the course, I was really looking forward to the IDP since my first 3 projects were amazing. However, I personally didn&#39;t have a great experience with my IDP host which is a shame because the IDP is supposed to be your most comprehensive project. I think Springboard could improve on vetting potential companies/hosts for their IDP. I did bring this issue up to Springboard and they tried to make it right by giving me a recommendation letter which I appreciated, but it doesn&#39;t really change the fact that my IDP experience wasn&#39;t the greatest. However, what really made Springboard an overall great experience was the support I was given along the way. The one-on-one mentorship you receive is priceless. I really appreciate the overwhelming amount of advice and support I was given by my designated mentor. Overall, I would recommend Springboard!

Instructional videos with Colt Steel, I mean what else do you need to know. I am sure a lot of others are good as well, so I won&rsquo;t say they are the best. But Springboard really sets itself apart from the pack in two ways: 1) Mentoring/Advising There are on-call assistants who can help you debug assignments. They can be accessed at the drop of a hat during pretty wide ranging available hours. You are also assigned a Mentor who you have a 1-1 30 minute weekly session with. They are working professionals giving you advice as a side gig. So not only can they help you with any technical questions, they can also offer insight into life working in the field you are pursuing. You can also request a handful of additional 30 minute 1-1 sessions throughout the course. 2) Career Coaching While this is really an extension of mentoring advising, it gets its own separate bullet because it is actually a part of your curriculum. From the earliest part of the course you have scheduled career development assignments. This ensures that your preparedness for seeking a job, getting/doing interviews, and landing a first tech job progresses on a track that coincides with your technical skills development. The only possible con would be if you weren&rsquo;t looking for a job. If that is the case then the price is a bit steep for the technical skill development alone. But they intentionally market themselves to job seekers.

To be fair however, I wasn&rsquo;t 100% committed to this path when I enrolled and definitely didn&rsquo;t give it my all. They give you a &lsquo;mentor&rsquo; that checks in on you and your progress with the assignments however the content was all over the place. I never knew what I was supposed to be reading or working on. My particular mentor was nice and smart but kind of would go on long winded misguided tangents rather than giving me any level of real instruction. I never understood the structure of what I should be doing - and I was working full time and didn&rsquo;t perhaps give it the level of attention needed. I did not see the program through and dropped out but they still billed me for it all (6,000 if I recall). If you&rsquo;re looking for tailored instruction this won&rsquo;t provide that.

The career search units were extremely helpful as well, since most people enroll in this course with the intention of finding a job afterwards. The mentor calls were a life saver as well.

My last mentor really helped me gain confidence in my skills and abilities, preparing me for the job hunt as I move forward. This is where the hiccups I had took place. I loved my last mentor, but he was the fourth mentor I had in 8 months. The mentorship factor is why I chose Springboard over the other bootcamps, which I was often left disappointed and frustrated. Whether this was mentors who left the program or mentors who did not provide me with guidance, there was always an issue. I felt that this impacted my learning experience negatively. That being said, the customer support at Springboard is phenomenal! Every time I had an issue with a mentor, billing, or scheduling they responded quickly and provided compensation. They were so kind and understanding with every issue I went to for them. Overall, Springboard was a great program and that prepared me for my transition. You get out of the program what you put into it, there are resources that will support you every step of the way. I wish there was more collaboration throughout the program, as that is when I really felt myself grow as a designer (which wasn&#39;t until my last month of the program).

I have never been to a school that understands my struggle and does not give up on me. As for the curriculum, there was a lot to digest and practice. I liked how you were asked to practice the skill you just learned at the end of every unit. However, given it&#39;s a comprehensive curriculum (UX/UI design track), it&#39;d be an intense program to finish within 9 months.

The course overall did an excellent job of preparing me for the three different types of difficult interviews designers face during their job search process. The mentorship aspect was also wonderful. My mentor taught me many valuable concepts that aren&#39;t in the curriculum with his extensive real world experience. The most positive aspects are the mentorship, UX research curriculum, and interview prep. The aspects that need a bit of work are the main technology tool promoted and how the portfolio walkthrough is taught. I recommend to anyone viewing my review to use Figma right when you start learning and applying UX principles. Don&#39;t use Sketch. Figma has an integrated prototype capability while Sketch doesn&#39;t have this feature. Switching between many different softwares feels like a headache. Also, spend more time on your portfolio earlier in the course than recommended. Request longer sessions with your mentor than the course advocates for.

I had always been pushed towards IT and finally decided to try my hand and self-teach some skills to see if I would like it. UI/UX was so new to me, but the idea of combining tech and design was so intriguing, I decided to research more into the field. I didn&#39;t realize how many boot camps were out there that offered a UI/UX course. It took me 2 months to finally research my way through all the courses and figure out which one offered the best outcome with the money I was about to dish out. It was scary jumping into something new, especially since I had read so many mixed reviews on whether boot camps were worth the time/effort/money or not. Springboard honestly went above and beyond the expectations I had! The amount of support you get from all sides was what really pushed me to enroll with them. Weekly mentor calls with an industry expert, career support, and a community to connect with other students is what really helped me throughout the program. I also love that Springboard gives you 4 projects to complete within the course, allowing to showcase more variety in your work when it comes time to build a profile. I didn&#39;t feel like I was on my own, I always had someone to reach out to if I had questions or needed immediate feedback, but I also didn&#39;t feel like I was working on someone else&#39;s time and could pace myself according to my personal schedule.

When I was deciding on a UX/UI bootcamp, I was hesitant to sign up for a longer/more expensive bootcamp, but am very glad I went with Springboard. Here are some of the key reasons why: The weekly mentor (an industry professionals) calls are super helpful and help you get immersed into the UX/UI field. My mentor helped me understand UX/UI concepts, and helped me refine the deliverables to build my case studies up! You come out of the course with a full portfolio (essential for getting a job!) with four case studies including an Industry Design Project, which is essentially an internship with a company. This real-world experience is really helpful coming out of the course! The curriculum does a good job teaching you UX/UI concepts and slowly building those up. Career guidance is prompted throughout the course, which was extremely helpful. Throughout the course, you are prompted early on to start building career skills such as networking. You also have calls with a career coach while you are simultaneously going through the technical material. This early prompting to start thinking about how you are going to get a job and slowly building skills necessary for this were extremely helpful for me. You come out of the course with an updated UX/UI resume as well as a updated and revised (by career coach) Linkedin. You are assigned a student advisor which helps you keep moving along. Having someone to keep me on track was essential for me. She gave me weekly deadlines that I needed to meet in order to complete by the date I gave her. Having this was a game changer for me. Finally, you are connected with a Springboard slack community, so you are able to meet other students in the course. This is really helpful as the course is remote, and helps you stay connected to others and meet new people who are in a career shift as you. I met a lot of wonderful friends along the way, while also building up my professional network. If you are wanting to shift careers, Springboard is a great choice!

The course is extremely flexible, which makes it a great option for those who are working full time. The content itself was mostly very easy to understand when going through the learning material. However, some of the material was outdated or not explained well (e.g. it took a while to understand that negative space and white space were the same thing since it was never explained). I liked how the course took you through practice exercises first before you start on your projects. You get four total projects, a Capstone 1, Design Sprint, Capstone 2, and IDP. In each project, you do both the design and research, so each one is very comprehensive for your future portfolio. The Job guarantee requirements are a bit intense, they make you do a lot of work in one week, but it makes sense if they give you an option for a refund. In terms of portfolio building, I was a bit worried about building it at first, but the examples and guide provided gave me a good idea on how to create a portfolio.

I just finished the course and am about to start my job hunt. In my opinion, this is the best curriculum I&#39;ve seen.

282647,2021.0,False,Killer Bootcamp and Community!,"<p>I am a recent Springboard grad with 2 years of experience studying Computer Science in college prior. I decided that I&#39;d prefer to learn in a safer and more secure format with Springboard&#39;s job guarantee than potentially not get hired post college and be drowning in student loans -- even though tech is definitely a field in which most will do absurdly well financially. When everything is already online, you really don&#39;t miss out on much in comparison to university. College really only has one big advantage still and that&#39;s the experience of being around other students of different disciplines, belief structures, etc. With COVID, that advantage has been stripped. Math too I suppose... But you can always come back to college after gaining some experience and savings to pay for your tuition without excess stress. I&#39;m happy to say that for me, it was an excellent decision. No one thought it was though -- my family, friends, and even some of my CS student peers thought it was a poor decision, some probably still do. That said, I started the program in late Oct. of 2020 and finished in early Oct. 2021, almost a full year, which honestly I did not expect as I have a bit more background in CS and figured that&#39;d make it go quicker. Here&#39;s why it took me a bit longer, in April, I got hired as a software engineer! I worked part time to pay for my living expenses throughout the rest of the course and am now transitioning to a fulltime role. My advice, don&#39;t listen to others even when they may have your best interest in mind. They hardly know what they&#39;re doing with their own lives, forge your own path. If you want it and are ready/willing to put in the work, you will more than likely find success. I recommend this bootcamp heavily. I think it&#39;s an excellent choice for those who are confident that they want to be software engineers. The mentors, career advisors, and other resources are definitely excellent, but at the end of the day, all the best programmers are mostly self-taught. It&#39;s important to be sure you are ready for this though. While I do believe that anyone can be an excellent software engineer, the profession/industry is not always for everyone. Learn some basic programming first and make sure you really do enjoy the process of debugging, googling, and sitting for hours day after day, that is exactly what you&#39;re signing up for. If you&#39;re okay with that, then sign up, you won&#39;t be disappointed!</p>",10/21/2021,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

282442,2021.0,False,Very solid course with in depth projects,"<p>Very much enjoyed my time with Springboard. I think one of the strongest parts of the course were the capstone assignments. Each assignment is an in depth, step by step process that gives the student a real time look into what is required of them in the real world in this field. These assignments required a lot of work, however the knowledge gained through them was incredibly valuable to me. In addition, the career support is another very strong aspect of the course. The mentorship program was immensely helpful for me in getting real feedback from people with actual experience in the field. The only real con that I can think of, is at times it can feel as though you are simply clicking on an article, reading about a concept, and that&#39;s it. In other words I felt there were a few moments where the curriculum could&#39;ve been a little more engaging. However, these same concepts come up in the capstone assignments, which as said above tended to a real step by step, work heavy process.

282438,2021.0,False,Affordable and at your own pace,"<p>I was attracted to Springboard for the tuition since it was much cheaper compared to other bootcamps while not breaking your wallet. I saved up for the tuition and paid in full. The curriculum is very dense and teaches Python and JS so students get a sense of different languages and the more popular frameworks so I really liked that! I also appreciate the mock coding, interview, and project interviews you need to pass in order to complete the program. It really reflected and prepped me for real interviews I got afterwards. Career counselors also help you tailor your resume, Linkedin, and interivews to increase your chances of getting noticed. You get TA support and depending on who you get, some are more direct with their answers while others make suggestions. I know some students have issues with the TAs but it&#39;s also reflective of real life work environments so it did not bother me. You get a a weekly 30 min mentor call who provides you with project feed back, advice as a developer or any other job questions you want to ask them about. The one thing I did not like about this program was the lack of peer reviews. I was lucky to be in a group with other students where we were able to stimulate this but communicating with your cohorts is all up to yourself. I would have loved it if there was some form of collaboration between students and made it up by volunteering externally. Other than that I think Springboard is good for those who are tight on finances and/or able to be self-motivated to learn the content.</p>",10/15/2021,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Springboard has certainly built a great curriculum that gave me very solid foundational skills and a fundamental understanding of the industry. Springboard showered me with plenty of amazing resources that I continue to use even after graduating (I had to get very good at organizing my bookmarks). By far THE BEST part about Springboard is the 1 on 1 mentoring. I had weekly calls with my mentor who demonstrated a high level of industry knowledge, and was able to give excellent feedback and insight to my projects and questions. Over the course of 9 months you&rsquo;re able to develop a relationship with your mentor, and add them to you network of professionals. To me this is where Springboard shined. The cons (kind of): That being said I&rsquo;m not sure bootcamps are for everybody. I already came into the UX/UI Design Career Track as a self-taught front-end developer and my web development skills played a crucial role in landing my position. You need to be a certain type of person to succeed in a boot camp. I consistently went above and beyond for my Capstone projects, and Portfolio. I would study design disciplines outside of what was offered in the normal curriculum as well. If you&rsquo;re an ambitious self-self starter then these bootcamps really can propel you into your next career. However if you tend to take a passive approach to your learning then look elsewhere.</p>",10/12/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.3,[],5.0,5.0,3.0,springboard

The weekly mentor calls are the strongest part of the course and gave me more support and accountability than public high school or university ever did. If you decide to go with Springboard make sure to stay on top of your work as it is self paced and you can fall behind.

281920,2021.0,False,Highly recommend the DAC bootcamp to jumpstart your career in analytics/data,"<p>I only have Pros with this program. Springboard&#39;s bootcamp services are the career counseling support you wish you had in undergrad and never got! The only cons I think would be not understanding that the field of data, analytics, business, tooling, all of it, is a huge field and there is so much to learn and know. Understand that any bootcamp is creating a foundation of skills. It&#39;s really a taster of the field. The bootcamp a great sandbox environment to learn, play, and and test things out in a safe, supportive environment. Pros Curriculum is excellent Numerous touchpoints throughout the bootcamp. --Student Advisor --Dedicated Mentor who guides you through the program --Office hours with a Springboard person --Great Slack network --Mentor on Demand - multiple people --Career Counseling --Several mock interviews both technical and behavioral You are then a part of a really big network full of interesting people who have all kinds of backgrounds. You get a lot of exposure, guidance, and help for troubleshooting. I took the online self-paced full time version. I happened to get a job within the first 8 weeks of the program and took a 4 month pause to onboard to that role and then complete the rest of the bootcamp for the final two months. Everyone was very supportive, patient, and really helped with managing stress, burnout, and motivation. It&#39;s really nice to be learning the material in a safe, supportive environment and know that everyone is interested and vested in your success. The curriculum is comprehensive and the resources shared are amazing. Before enrolling in Springboard&#39;s program, I tried to create my own bootcamp but it turns out that it is very difficult to find appropriate data when you yourself are outside of a business context (meaning, a lot of data is proprietary). I learned a little bit on my own but the structure and progression of the program is really worth the price tag. It really is an investment and opens your world up to a lot of great networking opportunities and practice. For Tooling, the curriculum follows Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. You complete case studies and projects using these tools. Remember that it&#39;s the business problem that&#39;s driving the tool usage and not the other way around. Be agnostic to tools and solutions, but it&#39;s really about the business problem you&#39;re solving for. There is also the core skills associated with data analytics and that&#39;s the financial perspective, the economic perspective, and the statistical perspective, all underpinned by strategic frameworks. Springboard is like a compressed MBA in this way and jumpstarts your business understanding if you don&#39;t already have it. Remember that the bootcamp is creating a strong foundation for you on which to build your data skills. You cannot become a subject matter expert in a matter of months, it does take years, so understanding that is really key as you make a career change.</p>",9/30/2021,Data Analytics Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

281828,2021.0,False,"Great online program that teaches you the foundations, helps you build a network, and gives you support in the job search","<p>I just finished the Springboard UX Career Track and have begun my Job Search as of today. I first heard about Springboard when I was looking at changing my career path, and my friend suggested I look into UX and the course Springboard offered (they had never gone to Springboard, only heard of it). From my research, UX ended up being a field that intrigued and excited me but finding an online course that would work for me was the hinge-point - specifically because I&#39;ve had poor experiences with work alone and remotely. Springboard&#39;s mentorship program and Job Guarantee (which I was eligible for) were the two factors that led me to choose them over other schools. Initially, the admission counselors told me that the course would be completely achievable within 6 months while continuing to work, which cemented my decision. The course is laid out in way that really grounds you in the concepts of UX and leads you through step-by-step. You learn the processes of research, interviews, affinity mapping, user personas, ideation, wireframing, prototyping, testing, and more, all on your capstone project. When that&#39;s completed, you take all the skills you&#39;ve learned and create a new project with a week in a modified Google Ventures design sprint. And lastly, you dip your toes into the real world as you&#39;re partnered with a real company to meet their UX needs over the course of a couple weeks. All this is laid out in an easy-to-follow curriculum that shows you exactly where you are and what&#39;s coming next. To me, the most effective and helpful part of Springboard is the plentiful mentorship they provide you and the Slack community of other students. Not only are you partnered with a great mentor who has spent years in the field (shout-out Noemi), but you have access to all of the other mentors at Springboard to pick their brains and talk to them about the industry and field. Not only are there mentors for the curriculum, but for your career search too. And the Slack community allowed me to connect with plenty of other students where we could examine each other&#39;s work, commiserate about our projects, and give us a better sense that we&#39;re not doing this alone. For me, the negative of the course was the time estimate for how long the course would take. To be fair, I may be an &#39;over-worker&#39; and putting more time and effort into some projects than was necessary, but I finished the course nowhere near the 6-month mark that was originally pitched. I was working on the course while working a remote job at the same time, and I finished the course nearly 4 months after my original end date. To Springboard&#39;s credit, they do have safety nets for those in my position. Because I could show I was actively working and had the support of my mentor, they had some extensions available for people in my situation. Thankfully, I was able to complete the entire course within the extensions that were available without having to pay for extensions or losing my job guarantee. Ultimately, I feel that the course has given me the tools and the mindset to enter into this new career and actually get a job. The mentorship program was essential for me to do my best and stay on track, and I don&#39;t think I would have had nearly the same experience without it. Their time estimates are extremely optimistic (unless maybe you&#39;re doing the course full-time) but they do support the students who need it. If you are looking for a UX course, I would highly suggest Springboard.</p>",9/27/2021,UX Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

281812,2021.0,False,I got a REALLY good job before I even finished the program.,"<p>Overall, I really love Springboard and it was personally a really great fit for me. Overall: This program was a lot of work. I thought I would finish well before the nine months...I did not. Realistically, I had a full time job and was taking this course and I would say that their suggestion of nine months is very accurate. It also allows you time to circle back to old projects and improve them and really let your brain be the awesome sponge it is and absorb all it can. I got real feedback on my projects from hiring managers, career coaches, and my mentor, all of which were actually rigorous and making sure your work is up to standard. As the title says, If you stick with Springboard and really actively try to improve your skills, I got a job before I even finished the program with my new skills (and a good one at that). Pros: - My mentor was my absolute lifeline and made the program feel &quot;real&quot; which for me, as someone who avoids social activity at all cost, was huge because I had to talk to her weekly making sure I had something I could bring to her to talk about every week. Basically, I&#39;m the kind of person who goes &quot;all-in&quot; on something for like two months and then forgets about it and drops it, my mentor was the core component of that not happening. - The support system is great - Sometimes I think things like career coaches, mentors, etc. are overrated, but I was surprised at how much value I actually got from these mandatory meetings I would have otherwise passed on. Room for improvement: - My IDP (real job experience) wasn&#39;t great, but Springboard staff was extremely helpful in navigating the situation, I would say my IDP experience was more or less a rare experience and other Springboard students seem to have had a great one. I wouldn&#39;t really expect to get a job from the IDP if you had any hopes in that. However, the career coaches at the end of the program will be very helpful to you in finding a job so no worries there. I would say, even if you don&#39;t have the best IDP experience, it&#39;s still job experience to put on your resume which is huge. - Its very easy to just say you completed the reading by checking the box without actually doing it, I would love to see some sort of short quiz that verifies you went over the material incorporated into the program even if it isn&#39;t graded, just some sort of feedback to myself that I should&nbsp;go back and read more carefully. In Summary: I&#39;ve talked to other people from other bootcamp programs who don&#39;t have nearly as good outcome as springboard. A lot of them are six months out still looking for jobs and (with peace and love) don&#39;t have nearly as solid case studies (in some cases these programs don&#39;t even make you do case studies which are ESSENTIAL in landing a job) ...as Springboard students.</p>",9/27/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

The curriculum was engaging and Springboard does a great job overall of making students feel like they&#39;ve grasped the material and have people to reach out to for support if needed. They also make sure you have the appropriate job materials in place (LinkedIn, resume, elevator pitch, web portfolio...) and have had a chance to practice mock interviews to prepare you for your job search. What I would offer for improvement would be the portrayal of the job guarantee. I think it would be great if Springboard was more directly involved in connecting students with internships, relevant resources, or even potential employers based on their background, interests, and demonstrated success while working through the curriculum (The IDP project is not quite an internship). At first, this is what I thought was meant by job guarantee but I realized when attending the coaching calls that the student is expected to build a network on their own and try to find people who will be willing to do informational interviews with them and then try to leverage those connections. This is fine, but a bit different from what I thought would be provided and I think that if Springboard was more proactively involved in helping students connect with relevant people or resources that could turn into opportunities this would make their program even stronger and the job guarantee more compelling.</p>",9/25/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard

While there were occasionally problems with dead links, these always seemed to be fixed relatively quickly. Springboard was the strongest in career coaching. I&#39;m confident in my technical skills, but have always felt uneasy while networking. Springboard&#39;s coaches offered plenty of assistance in that regard. I have no regrets about taking this course.</p>",9/22/2021,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

281543,2021.0,False,Springboard built me and made me successful,"<p>If you want be challenged or enjoy being challenged, then Springboard is for you. If you want to be successful in as little as 4 months to 6months, then Springboard is for you. When I started Springboard I wasn&rsquo;t very sure what I was doing. All I knew was that I want to transition to new career. I have a mechanical engineering and Mathematics background and wanted to transition into data science. It took me a year of research before choosing Springboard. I tell my friends that Springboard built me and they understand why. In just 4 months of intensive studies I built my first computer vision system, and performed 3+ personal data analysis and predictive modeling projects. Springboard mentors and coaches are another level, those guys will push you and work with you till you start seeing yourself for who you are truly. Springboard offers flexibility so I took breaks to have fun and returned to the course to help my sanity. Although I went really hard on myself because I was on their job guarantee, I really think it would be the same experience for anyone who wants it as bad as I did. One month before my course completion I was getting interviews already. A month later after completion, I had 4 job offers to choose from. And that wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even after I accepted one of the initial offers, more came in. I started the course in January and finished in July. I took multiple breaks which sums up to 2 months. I invested 40+ hours a week in July while working full time job to finish the remaining course. I started the program as a prep student and then took the exam and was admitted into the career track. If you aren&rsquo;t afraid of challenge, I encourage you to try it out. They have slack community I found helpful throughout my prep course and career track course. As soon as I was admitted into the career track, and understood the basics I started using stack overflow and library documentations more when I need help or trapped. The mentors( meets you 1:1 weekly) also gave me resources that helped me. All of my mentors were working as in an industry in a data science field and gave me up to date information.

After going through the process judiciously and with great dedication, I can confidently say Springboard has helped me build a robust and very competitive portfolio. The curriculum typically covers everything needed to succeed. My favorite part of Springboard is the one-on-one mentorship where you could brainstorm, learn and typically create a connection with a professional who is willed to help you succeed. Also, the career coaches are really helpful. The underestimated section where many students miss out is the Springboard slack community where you get all the answers, motivation and collaborations on almost any topic. However, I would suggest Springboard encourage collaborations between students by adding a group capstone project. This would benefit on many levels -- technical skill like git usage and soft skills like teamwork, collaboration etc.</p>",9/14/2021,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
281403,2021.0,False,Springboard UI/UX Career Track Bootcamp,"<p>After doing a ton of research on UX bootcamps, I chose Springboard because it met the most criteria. Overall, I am happy with the education I got from this program. However, I was fortunate to be involved with 2 study groups of great individuals (one I was invited to, one I started) that met weekly for 1 hour on skype and were great about sharing resources. I also had a good mentor that I got along well with, and began meeting with career coaches early and often. Pros of this program: &bull; The curriculum is well-structured and covers a wide expanse of UX methodology &bull; The program is set up to give you some breathing room - although it is structured for 9 months, it actually allows for almost 12 months to complete &bull; The mentoring and career coaching pieces are really valuable, and each student will have a unique mentor along with access to unlimited mentors &bull; Your student advisor will support and advocate for you &bull; I feel very confident in what I have learned and have gotten confirmation that I&#39;m adding value to the company I&#39;m working for now &bull; You will get out of this program what you are willing to put in - if you are smart and strategic about the methods you use and the work you make, it will work for you Cons of this program: &bull; The impetus is totally on the student to be responsible for their own learning - if you are someone that needs a teacher to walk you through new ideas, tools, and techniques, this is not the program for you &bull; The estimated 17 hrs work/week is unrealistic if you are working full-time, have a family, or other life obligations beyond this program. The program does work with you so you can complete, but it probably won&#39;t be in 9 months (think about this with your payment structure) &bull; There are some poorly structured deliverables that definitely feel like working harder, not smarter. Look ahead at the curriculum, especially once you start putting together your case studies, and build toward your portfolio (not google documents). &bull; Some of the resources are outdated &bull; It can be difficult to find any available times to schedule meetings with career coaches and/or unlimited mentors Springboard isn&#39;t perfect - nothing is.

The unlimited mentorship meetings and Springboard staff were amazing guides along my learning journey. The curriculum was presented in an easy to follow program and I liked that it was also easy to go back to earlier content if I needed to review. The curriculum was a mix of reading and videos content, although I would&#39;ve preferred more video content for my learning style. I also prefer a classroom type environment but learning from home was much better for my complex schedule. The draw back is if I had a question with the content I could not get an immediate answer although Springboard does provide various avenues of support to get your questions answered asap.

281268,2021.0,False,Springboard was a smooth ride experience.,"<p>Pros: a lot of resources: your weekly mentor, TA support live chat, TA email, on-demand mentor calls, office hours, and the slack community. All of these can be utilized for help to progress through the course. The course cover topics that other boot camps do not cover, such as data structures and algorithms, testing your code, git control, and more. A well-structured course with an excellent person who does the course videos, I found his voice to be pleasant to listen to and humorous sometimes. Cons: At the end of the course, if you&#39;re going for a job guarantee from the program, you&#39;re required to pass all 4 mock interviews and you&#39;re allowed 3 attempts each. I didn&#39;t find their resource to be that helpful in terms of preparing for the coding and whiteboard mock interviews.

While the curriculum is good, the two independent capstone projects is where I learned the vast majority of the skills and knowledge I needed to be a data scientist. I am not sure I would have been able to do these projects without the aid of my mentor. I was truly surprised by how much I learned, and at about 2/3 of the way through the course, I was able to apply what I learned to my current job by developing all kinds of machine learning applications. The career coaching was also a huge benefit in teaching me how to look for jobs, network, as well as develop resumes, Linkedin profile, and cover letters.</p>",9/7/2021,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
281231,2021.0,False,"Great mentorship, good practice exercises from datacamp resource , okay curriculum","<p>Pros: Datacamp resource - I really liked in-browser coding paired with short lecture videos to be very effective to get practice with the key parts of data science problem solving. There were lots of practice exercises that helped give me a better understanding of the concepts. Mentorship - I really liked my mentor, he was very experienced and had lots of industry knowledge, and it was obvious he had a strong grasp of the subject matter. As a part of the curriculum you work on 2 Capstone projects, and several other ad-hoc projects with the guidance of your mentor. My mentor provided helpful feedback and advice for lot of the machine learning methods I tried and gave me a starting point to work on the project. Cons: Many parts of Springboard curriculum is just reading articles on data science or youtube recordings which can be find online. The video/audio quality was not the best. I think it would have been much better for Springboard to make some videos covering perhaps similar material but improve audio and video quality and create a more cohesive curriculum instead of many seemingly unrelated videos. Also, none of the assignments have answer keys provided to students, so there are not many ways to check your work. The machine learning unit&#39;s videos and assignments are almost entirely taken from a college class. The ad hoc projects were useful to get practical examples to refer to, but a few lectures from the class did not feel adequately sufficient to develop a good understanding of machine learning concepts and AI techniques.</p>",9/7/2021,Data Science Career Track,2.7,[],3.0,3.0,2.0,springboard

281135,2021.0,False,Overall a great start to swapping careers.,"<p>Springboard overall gets the job done. The curriculum was sufficient enough to prepare you for intro positions for analytics if you are just getting into it. If you already have a background connected to data analytics then this is a solid course to help you expand your skillset or pivot your career choice. They will teach you or expose you to fundamentals of Excel, SQL, visualization tools, and Python adequately. You will learn how to read charts and data. There is a good amount of hands on experience to gain while working through the course. Most of their partners they use for the curriculum have descent courses but some are not great for beginners with code. They&#39;re support team with the advising team was excellent, understanding, and prompt when I needed help. They also were great at introducing you to the community among the alumni and students. They also provided great resources like access to awesome online informational events that also provided networking . This is also just my experience with the 2 advisors I had. Sarah and Molly. The Career mentoring seemed beneficial for someone unexperienced with the job search or network building. I did feel like the calls I did were good but were lacking. This was not the mentors fault in my opinion. They most likely have to big of a work load. This comes out in how rushed the call feels and the mentor can not take extra time to really connect with the student and flesh out the purpose of the call. This also forces some of them to stick to there script to hit all their points during the call. I will say the mentors that I used were friendly and informative. There&#39;s also a on call support team that will help you whenever you get stuck. I only used it once but it was nice to have available. You get a assigned mentor that works in the industry and acts as your professor pretty much if compared to regular college. I had an excellent mentor that was kind, patient, and knowledgeable.

281131,2021.0,False,Learn at your own pace!,"<p>Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Springboard. It was a different experience for me to attend online courses, rather than in person, but a good and necessary one especially for these times of the pandemic. I like the self-paced learning that it has because there are times that life get&#39;s busy. This really helped me to just dial in what I was learning. If I wanted to spend more time in one subunit, I could and if I wanted to breeze through it, I could as well. The only con to this is that you get 9 months to finish the course, though that is a lot of time to finish the course, it does take away from the statement at your own pace because you have to finish in 9 months. My suggestion is to follow their schedule guide of how long you should spend in a subunit and keep to it. Some suggestions are longer than others and that is good, because if you finish a subunit early, then that just means you have more time to finish the other ones that take longer. Another suggestion I have is to look ahead at what you will be working on (both for Springboard and in your own personal schedule). When you get a bigger picture of what you have to do, you can easily manage your time accordingly. I like the mentor lead aspect of Springboard. It&#39;s good to get feedback from a professional and very helpful when you get stuck in certain areas of the course. My mentor helped me gain a better perspective of visual hierarchy and made me a better UI/UX designer. The downside to this is that you have one meeting a week with your mentor to check in with you which is a 30-minute call. So you&#39;ll need to know exactly what you want to talk about in those sessions. Also, Springboard gives you unlimited scheduled calling with your mentor, but it&#39;s scheduled and sometimes you need answers to questions you have at the moment. To get around this, you can simply email your mentor and they usually respond within a day or two. Another great aspect is the coaching calls. You&rsquo;ll get the first-hand experience with real hiring managers in the field. My coaches have helped me look at their perspective of what they would look for in a UX/UI Designer and what pitfalls to avoid. Through the mock interviews, they have given me great feedback that will help me in interviews and with their keen eyes, they have helped me craft both a great resume and portfolio.

Because the work is self-paced, it does mean that you are watching a lot of videos, reading articles, and doing online practice through things like LinkedIn Learning and DataCamp. However, you are definitely not alone. Once a week, you check in with your mentor, there are one-on-one mentor calls that you can schedule with different mentors, and there is a very strong and supportive online Slack channel. The data analytics course leads you through five main skills - Excel, statistics, SQL, Tableau/Power BI and Python, all of which have projects supporting them. Additionally, there is a big emphasis on job skills throughout the course and you are given several check-ins with career coaches (you can choose to work with the same one or switch up throughout). As I have recently finished the course, I am now experiencing the post-completion part of the program, which offers you even more job support in the form of additional meetings with a career coach.

280209,2021.0,False,Springboard is totally worth it!,"<p>I just got my certificate from Springboard last week and I feel that I had a very positive experience. My background is that I am coming from being a classroom teacher, so I started as a total novice as far as design skills and job/networking skills. Pros: - 1:1 mentor support--my mentor was excellent and I appreciated his feedback and the resources and tips he shared with me. I definitely wouldn&#39;t have gotten so far without having one mentor that I saw every week -Career coaching--the career coaching has been super helpful. I&#39;ve always gotten actionable items on how to search for a job better, how to network, ask for informational interviews, and on resume writing -the projects--I feel that I have four strong case studies to show for my work at Springboard and I feel that in an interview or actual job setting, I have the field of knowledge employers will want -They listen to feedback! Cons: -The Industry Design Project was where I worked with 3 other Springboard students, and working with the other students was a good experience but I feel that our project honestly didn&#39;t have enough work for 4 people and I feel like this may be a &quot;growing pain&quot; for them. Something I have seen listed as a con when I was researching the bootcamp was that their curriculum is made up of articles and videos you could look up on your own. First of all, that&#39;s not entirely true. They have a lot of stuff exclusive to Springboard. Also, if you are starting from a base level of almost zero like I was, there&#39;s no way I would have known what I needed to look up or get feedback from a mentor. Last thing: They were SO understanding with me while I was taking the course. I was teaching full time and the pandemic made that more time consuming, my daughter got Covid, and I had several other family emergencies and my student advisor and mentor were extremely understanding even though I kept having to pause/freeze</p>",8/11/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

The curriculum is well planned and you learn a wide variety of skills. I also enjoyed meeting with a mentor each week to be able to ask questions when I was stuck or uncertain. For my Capstone project, I was able to use both Python and Tableau for the analysis which was exciting as I had been completely unfamiliar with both of these tools before starting this course.

The course is self-paced so there is no meeting times outside of office hours but there are TA&#39;s available to help whenever you need them during the weekdays. There are a lot of smart people going through this boot camp and so your classmates can be a great resource for learning new topics and working on projects. The mentor aspect was one of the best parts of springboard because of the access to a working professional and my mentor was knowledgeable about so many parts of web development that there was almost never a question he didn&#39;t have an answer to. I feel where the course lacked was in creating a sense of community and sometimes I felt like I was alone in my struggles. The curriculum is hard but not impossible and if you are persistent and deliberate in your approach you will succeed. I would recommend this course if your availability is variable and you can&#39;t attend an in-person boot camp or one that meets regularly. The career and interview coaches are some of the best, and will push you to succeed. The people that do the mock interviews and the code reviews for Springboard are at huge FAANG level companies and are some of the most knowledgeable people that you have access to.</p>",8/6/2021,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Pros: Create your own schedule, thorough video tutorials for all subject matters in full-stack web development, knowledgeable mentors and TAs, low tuition price compared to other bootcamp programs, guidance on how to build professional network Cons: TAs and support can at times be hard to access, self-accountability is important since course is self-paced</p>",8/6/2021,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard

I come from a multi-disciplinary design background, and I&#39;ve had an interest in transitioning into the UX/UI field for a few years, so I was slowly self-learning and taking Coursera courses prior to starting the Springboard course. Unfortunately, Coursera courses and designing some apps for your portfolio just won&#39;t cut it. Springboard guides you through a range of key methodologies and best practices in UX design, with projects heavily focused on user research and usability testing, as well as plenty of mentoring from real industry professionals.

280013,2021.0,False,Great to Learn from the Industry's Best,"<p>The fully online, largely self-paced program made it possible for me to learn while coping with a demanding work schedule. Overall, I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed the curated program and the 1:1 mentorship. The mentorship is where I&rsquo;ve got the most out of this program. It really does give you an in-depth insight into how data scientists works, and their industry best practices. This program would be a great choice for those who: - wants to have direct interaction with career data scientists and learn about the industry best practices - can only or prefers to do a 100% online bootcamp - prefers a self-paced, self-learning type of program rather than a classroom style/ group work type of program Call outs: - if you reside outside of US/ Canada, certain career development topics/ opportunities may not be as relevant. Find a career coach you resonate with though, there are still a lot you can get out of the career coaching sessions - if you are in the Asia timezone, it will likely be difficult for you to enjoy the office hours and networking events. It&rsquo;s usually scheduled in the afternoon US Pacific timezone For those who are wondering if you can manage the program, my suggestion would be to try out the Data Science Prep Course. During the course of selecting which education provider to go for, I&rsquo;ve tried the prep course from a few bootcamp providers.

As a DJ looking to switch careers, the Prep course was very helpful in providing me a very basic understanding of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). In addition to a very user-friendly course, Springboard gave me a mentor (Adam G.) to help me if I ever got stuck on anything. We met weekly until I finished the course and passed the exam at the end, and Adam was so cool that I was sad that he wasn&#39;t going to be my mentor for the next 9 months of the Career Track course. Although I was a bit sad, my next mentor (Paul S.) turned out to be the perfect mentor for the next 9 months. He dedicated a significant amount of time to help me with any and all problems I had with assessments, projects, capstone projects, etc. He even let me shadow him for a work-day. Springboard has a user-friendly platform and I had no trouble navigating my way throughout their site. Not only did they provide the curriculum and tools to teach me about Software Engineering, but they also provided Career Coaches that guided me in making my resume and LinkedIn profile stand out. I could go on about how grateful I am for Springboard and for giving me the opportunity to meet some amazing people through them.

279984,2021.0,True,I feel prepared to get a Software Engineering Job,"<p>I just completed the curriculum for the Software Engineering Career Track at Springboard. I quit my previous career to pursue engineering, and enrolled at Springboard. This is the perfect course in my opinion for someone who is going to attend the course as a job essentially. I finished up the 9 month curriculum in just about 6 months, which was a pace that worked me. That flexibility to continue working as much as you want was nice. The course covered many frontend, backend, and database technologies including JavaScript, Node, Express, React, Redux, Python, Flask, SQL, and SQLAlchemy. The instructor, Colt Steele, is a personable guy and his videos explaining the concepts make sense. Each section provides some decent notes, and then at the end there is an exercise. Throughout the course, there&#39;s about 6-10 projects sprinkled in that will take you between 15 - 45 hours each, depending on which ones they are. I enjoyed the longer, full stack projects. One of the last portions of the project is the data structures and algorithms portion, and they have you take 4 mock interviews. These truly felt like real interviews and were challenging, I appreciated them, and I feel more ready to tackle real interviews.

The mentors have all been extremely supportive and helpful. The course mentor really gave the best insight on how to improve and praised what I was doing well, my student advisor was knowledgeable in all the course protocols and able to answer experience questions quickly and accurately, and the career mentors were great in teaching how to be successful during the job hunt.

There are lots of bootcamps out there, some are much better than others. I can only vouch for Springboard. I was skeptical I won&#39;t lie... a shortcut to a career with a job guarantee feels like it&#39;s too good to be true. It feels like you&#39;re cheating or something and people who went to school for this career must have a huge leg up. I&#39;m sorry, but I disagree. As someone who graduated from a top college university, I disagree with the long-drawn-out typical style of the educational system. What makes you good at something? Doing it, a lot. Hands-on experience. And 1 on 1 feedback. That&#39;s exactly what you get with Springboard. I had an amazing mentor and I hope you do too. We met each week. I started as someone with 0 experience in any design field. Nada. And I feel like a UX boss now that I&#39;ve finished. But look, no bootcamp is going to get you a job or make you a great designer as soon as you&#39;re done. It&#39;s all about what you put in, and if you put in the work and can work long hours solo while having accountability and feedback each week, this is a great bootcamp for you.

279757,2021.0,False,Great Bootcamp for Understanding and Practically Leveraging Data Analytics,"<p>I took Springboard&#39;s Data Analytics career track from Dec. 2020 to July 2021. I found the career track to be well structured, with a great overview of the data analytics process from top to bottom. You learn how to apply problem solving frameworks with technical skills, and then tell a story with your data. I took the career track as part of ongoing education at my current job, so I did not utilize the job support function of the program. That being said, the course absolutely helped me achieve my objective of creating a comprehensive mental model of the data analytics process; something I had known in many different parts over my career and the curriculum helped me to assemble into a comprehensive whole. I am confident in my ability to leverage data analytics to solve business problems, and extract value from data. The entire career track is a not-insignificant time commitment, and can definitely be challenging at parts (something I consider a good thing). You have regular mentor meetings which were very helpful to me in staying on track and collaborating on different ideas for the capstone projects. I liked how the curriculum pulled a variety of sources together and focused on practical examples. TLDR; Great investment for your time and money and this bootcamp will provide you the tools to provide value and leverage the power of data as a data analyst. I also think it forms a nice cornerstone for future learning (and continuing to build your own human capital!).</p>",7/28/2021,Data Analytics Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Some perks right at the beginning: self paced, different payment options, the mentor calls, extra calls, career coaches and an externship with a real company etc. The way the curriculum was structured was incredible, starting with the basics, but also in the approach, each topic was covered in different ways to help soak up the information as well as being able to then retain the knowledge if you have different learning styles. It seemed like each topic was covered by articles, videos, examples, practice homework etc! Even the features I did not use are still a huge reason why I chose Springboard (the slack channel, extra calls, office hours). I would suggest anyone considering this program to take their time!

279728,2021.0,False,Launched my Data Science career before the 6 months was up,"<p>About me - BA in Mathematics with an emphasis in Statistics from a State University (2019). 3.0 GPA -28 years old at the time -No internships, relevant work or volunteer experience in the tech field. In fact, my general work experience was 3 years at Mcdonalds, then 7 at a Resort as a bartender. -Spent 30-50 hours a week studying. 10-20 hours a week working on my resume, cover letter, connections, and job searching. -Got a job offer and accepted an entry level Data Scientist position at about 4-5 months into the program. Currently still in after 3 months, love it. Pros: -Springboard itself is great and has a lot of the materials needed to learn the basics of DS. The reading/videos/coding can be tiresome at time, but just take it one step at a time and you&#39;ll near the end eventually. Take good notes and read every single line, do as much as the coding as you can but don&#39;t spend too much time on it, spend more time on your capstones as these are what will probably make or break your chances of landing a DS position. Make a daily/weekly schedule to make sure you complete the program on time. I recommend 5-7% completion every week, at least for the first couple of months. It will get harder as you go and you will suffer burnout too. But if you could accomplish more early on when you&#39;re still full of energy, then you&#39;ll have some room to slow down or take a break later on in the course if needed. -Mentors are smart and always there if you need something -Career coaches are great. I recommend getting to know them early on as I feel like besides learning the DS skills itself, this part of the program was the most beneficial. Unfortunately, if you&#39;re like me with a not so pretty background, the coaches might hit you with some reality that you will most likely become a Data Analyst first before ever becoming a DS. But if you run into one that truly cares, they can help you out so much. I attribute my current DS position to my career coach&#39;s help. So while all the career coaches are great and helpful, if you can find one where you see that they truly care about you and your job search, I recommend making a connection with that person and making as much calls to them as possible. -Cost is relatively doable for the bootcamps I&#39;ve looked at so far. The payment options are nice as well -Customer service is excellent and quick to answer any questions Cons -Not sure if this is a true con, but many of study materials are free or attainable with a subscription fee. But that can be said about most schools too so. What&#39;s great is the structure and how one can learn the materials through repetition even though the beginning may be quite confusing. -Signed up for DS career track, but was told by many, except one, that I will most likely land a DA role before getting a DS position. Although that one person did help me beat the odds and get a DS position even though I&#39;ve no true experience. But this is rare apparently, and requires dedication. -There&#39;s not too much cons about Springboard itself.... Overall, if you stick to Springboard and can push yourself then you&#39;ll succeed.

The capstone projects, modified Google Ventures Design Sprint and Industry Placement Project provide you with an excellent foundation for writing the case studies that you will use in your first portfolio. I found the 1:1 weekly mentorship invaluable. You have an expert there to back you up, answer questions, and keep you on track. As a bonus, every single time I needed to reach out to the staff for one reason or another, the team was super helpful and quick to respond. If you want to work at your own pace and feel confident in your knowledge and skills when you hit the job market at the end, I&#39;d absolutely recommend Springboard&#39;s UI/UX Bootcamp.

I began the course because at the time I had more free time and time spent working and chose to use that free time to advance my UX skills so I&#39;d be able to land a job in the field I actually wanted to be in. Then Covid hit and suddenly my work took off, my UX Springboard course quickly fell by the wayside given how busy I was with work. Despite needing much more time than the original 9 months to complete the course Springboard was there at every turn, offering me pauses, freezes, month extensions, etc. They really went above and beyond to help me finish my course so I could maintain my job guarantee. The mentorship program was also incredibly helpful, while mine got off to a rough start with a mentor who missed our very first call, Springboard quickly replaced them with one who would go on to be an invaluable resource for the rest of my time with them.</p>",7/19/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Much of the material is sourced from existing websites, which may be a turn off for some. But I think that is helpful to become familiar with existing websites and tools that can support you in your career journey. The mentorship feature is probably what sets Springboard apart from the remaining bootcamps, and it is a feature that was very helpful. I was matched with a great mentor that helped me improve as I went through the class.

They match you with the mentor and with the Industry Design Project based on your interest and preferences and for me, it was a very accurate match.

279223,2021.0,True,SO WORTH IT,"<p>I was a little bit intimidated when I first signed up for the program. The prices are very reasonable. All that is required upfront is about $700 to save a seat in the class. They have many payment options which allow you to defer to pay any tuition fees until after you complete the program. The JOB GUARANTEE is what really hooked me. They have a great career services office with people who really care and are willing to help you write a resume and modify your LinkedIn profile in order to get maximum possible exposure. I was given an entry test to see where I feel on being at least well equipped to do well in the course. I passed it with no problem. I told them that although I passed, I still wasnt 100% comfortable and I felt like I needed more practice because they were concepts that I havent reviewed in years. They allowed me to take a 6 week course, prior to school beginning that enabled me to feel more confident. This preliminary course was $400. However, they told me that if I completed the course, then I would be refunded the $400. So if that&#39;s not a heck of an incentive to complete, then I dont know what is. Also, they have a mentor program and a mentor call once a week to ensure that the concepts are being understood and they also have a weekly Q &amp; A session. In other words, the resources are invaluable and I think this is so worth the money. Thank you everyone at springboard who had a hand in my growth and evolution.

279221,2021.0,False,Great program with a lot of support!,"<p>I think the main difference between springboard and a lot of other courses out there (I did a lot of research before deciding on Springboard) is the 1:1 guided support. You can talk to Springboard student support for student issues, you get assigned a personal mentor that you talk to once a week for the duration of the course, you can talk to other industry professionals whenever you want and you get a personal career coach. All of that makes Springboard an exceptional course and worth the money. If you have a question about anything, there&#39;s always someone to ask! The curriculum itself is very full and there are ways to take it beyond what Springboard offers you; there are many links within each learning resource where you can learn more in-depth if you want to. At the end of the course you will have a full portfolio with at least 4 UX projects and that will make any new career path or a career transition much more attainable. Having worked in the design field for many years, I can attest to the importance of a great portfolio and Springboard ensures you have that. I can&#39;t speak to the career search yet as I have not begun that part of the experience but with the job guarantee and the personal career coach support you get after the course, I have high hopes for success! Springboard UX/UI track is a lot of work (took me almost a year with a full time job) so definitely know that going into it - it&#39;s not a 10-week bootcamp.

There are some issues to be aware of, however. If you have some coding experience coming in, there&#39;s currently no way to skip parts of the course you already know. The curriculum relies heavily on Datacamp classes and videos. There are long stretches of the curriculum where all you&#39;re doing is watching videos of talks, lectures, etc. If this is not a good learning style for you, definitely consider something else. The capstone projects are great, but the learning curve is a bit steep between the first one, which is fully guided, and the second one, which is fully independent. In general you have to be a very self-motivated person to succeed with this curriculum. The biggest draws of this program are the mentoring and the job guarantee.

The Springboard workload is a lot like that, but for the duration of six months. The student advisors help you along, though, and you get 3 pauses that can be up to 3 weeks long. The curriculum covers everything. I had some knowledge of UX going in, but the bootcamp filled in the gaps I had in user research, data synthesis, and design planning while allowing me to practice and level up the skills I already had. The curriculum was a great curation of reading, lectures, and interactive lessons. Maybe I wish there were a few more lectures to break up the heavy reading units, but that&rsquo;s nitpicking. On your first week, you get paired with a mentor who helps you apply your learning to a steady stream of projects. My mentor was great. She always had an insight or a resource to guide me and never got frustrated when I struggled or fell behind. You aren&rsquo;t graded in the traditional way. You review project progress with your mentor, and they give you feedback to make changes. It&rsquo;s technically pass/fail, but in practice, it trades the stick and carrot for a kind of conversation that results in the best possible portfolio. Online learning is a different animal than in-person learning. You have to be good at managing your time and staying focused. If you need the social element of a classroom, digesting lessons over Slack with your peers is a poor substitute. Communication on Slack felt transactional. I did make a good friend toward the end of the curriculum on a team project, but I wish Springboard did more to make student interaction meaningful early on. I&rsquo;m sure there are a few hiring managers that would prefer to get a UX designer fresh out of Pratt, but Springboard does one thing better than any college I&rsquo;ve ever heard of: career support. It&rsquo;s part of the curriculum. They teach you how to build your network, a resume, a portfolio, then teach you how to interview and negotiate. It&rsquo;s not just something you quietly know you should be doing in the background; they properly teach you and provide feedback as you create each artifact. Now that I&rsquo;ve completed the curriculum, I feel good about the growth of this career field, I like my odds on the job market, and I have a career coach to check in with every other week.</p>",6/22/2021,UX Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

There&#39;s definitely a lot of info and a lot of work to do, but put in the time and effort and you&#39;ll be rewarded. My advice would be to really go over the material and make sure it sticks. The quicker you move through each section (HTML, CSS, JS,) the more they jumble together in your head since you&#39;re writing them all in the same program. Also, I recommend double checking with your mentor to see if the scheduled times are good. I had to switch mentors because our schedules never matched up. That was through no fault of the mentor, it was me, I live in Hawaii so I rarely interact online with people on my time. Anyways, I highly recommend the career prep and to put a lot of hours into it to set yourself up for success for the full track!</p>",6/21/2021,Software Engineering Career Track Prep Course,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

The mentorship is the highlight of the program; I loved working with Todd once a week to stay on track and receive feedback.

278647,2021.0,False,Springboard Data Science Bootcamp - an excellent decision!,"<p>There&#39;s so much to be said about how Springboard does an amazing job with the Data Science Career Track! 1)The curriculum is so thoughtfully and expertly designed. It manages to cover a wide range of topics, but in a manner that flows naturally both in terms of progressive difficulty and logical continuity. This to me, is so important for sustaining motivation to complete the program. 2)It is highly hands-on and project oriented. This is a good thing, always a good thing, and Springboard recognizes that. Almost every unit has at least one mini-project to explore the content covered in that unit within an implementation context. You also need to complete two Capstone projects of your choice in any areas of your interest as part of the curriculum, and these projects are great for your Github or your resume. Clearly, Springboard appreciates that project-oriented learning is essential to drive certain concepts home and again, sustain motivation by seeing the fruits of your labor. 3)The quality of the resources. Data Science experts on the Springboard Team have put in efforts to create high quality resources - both technical and career-oriented. These are usually well-drafted informational documents or videos. They also handpick a good selection of public articles/videos (and even one wonderful book) to supplement your learning, and their partnership with DataCamp (shoutout!) gives you access to a rich library of also high quality content. 4)Flexibility Look, Springboard gets that life happens, and they&#39;ve got your back. There is an option to take a 2-3 week pause from the course ANYTIME to perhaps catch up on other responsibilities or to maybe just *recharge*. Also, they offer a free 2 month extension to finish the program if you don&#39;t finish within the original 6 months, which can also turn out to be quite a blessing. I&#39;m a full-time CS student at UCLA, so when I ran into a difficult quarter, I could still manage because of their flexible options. 5)Community You&#39;re assigned a Student Advisor and Mentor as part of the program, and in my experience, they were both wonderful. The Student Advisor regularly checks in on you if you need help making goals, being productive, planning a schedule, tackling burnout, and more! They really help keep you afloat during your journey. You meet with your mentor on a weekly basis so they can guide you with projects and difficult material, or tell you more about the industry and their type of work, which is always interesting to hear! My mentor was super helpful with his feedback on my projects and helped me shape them into something I was proud of. I should also mention that support on their Slack is pretty good too for Q/A related things, their customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful, and their cohort of career coaches are also excellent, so be sure to make regular appointments with them because they give extremely valuable and insightful advice about the industry and building the professional profile you want for yourself. All-in-all, a great program designed by a talented team of industry professionals. The amount of knowledge and learning you get out of the program is priceless (and you get lifetime access to the curriculum!). If you&#39;ve got the time and you want to, as they call it, &quot;future-proof&quot; your career, I highly recommend their program :)</p>",6/21/2021,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
278644,2021.0,False,So happy I did this.,"<p>I recently completed the UI/UX Design program at Springboard and accepted a job as a UX Researcher shortly before graduating. The number one pro is the mentorship aspect. I got so much out the one-on-one instruction time with my mentor. He was so great at tailoring the projects and my portfolio to have more of a focus on UX Research which put me in a much better position when I started job seeking. The career coaches and mock interviews were also great. I was able to take advantage of the unlimited mentor calls to prepare for job interviews as well which helped so much. The only downside for me was the lack of group or classroom learning. This is a program that requires a kind of hustle and internal motivation which I sometimes struggle with. Some of the students put together an online study group which is helpful but mostly you have to be accountable to yourself.

I was so nervous to tackle a career change in my late 20s, and I was insecure about my design skills at first, but I can confidently say that I can see from where I started to now how much I have grown and improved. I have to say, it is challenging and rigorous, so if you&#39;re looking for something easy breezy this might not be for you, but if you&#39;re willing to put in the time and effort, this course will set you up for success in UI / UX design!</p>",6/19/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
278597,2021.0,False,"I chose Springboard because it made sense for my pace of learning and schedule, and I have no regrets.","<p>I was an accountant for 6 years and decided I was unhappy in it so I pursued Software Engineering for better work/life balance (among other things). I did Springboard from March 2020 - May 2021 (took multiple breaks). I started applying to jobs on May 30, 2021 and only interviewed with 1 company (1 phone screen and 1 virtual onsite) and received/accepted an offer yesterday, June 17, 2021, as a Software Engineer I. What convinced me to choose Springboard (in order of importance to me): 1. Flexibility - While I would rather go to an in-person classroom style bootcamp, I didn&#39;t want to do those 3-month intensive bootcamps where I had no time for anything else. Springboard provides remote learning and therefore, this teaching model wasn&#39;t affected by COVID (I applied in Feb 2020 and started in March 2020) and even prepares you for a remote job afterward, if that&#39;s your goal. 2. Instructor is good - If you want to see if you like his style, take Colt Steele&#39;s Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course or check out his Youtube channel. 3. Job guarantee - if you don&#39;t get a job within 6 months (I think with COVID, it&#39;s now a year) of graduating the course, you get a full refund. Be aware there are still requirements to follow in order to qualify to get the refund. 4. Accountability - weekly 1:1s with a paired mentor who is a professional in the industry 5. The topics the bootcamp covers are pretty extensive 6. Price - Given the amount of material, support, and timeframe, the price is way better than those 3 month intensive bootcamps. I chose the month to month payment plan, but if you can afford it, just pay upfront. After taking the course, here are my pros/cons: Pros: - Flexibility (see above) - Accountability - I had a really great and supportive mentor throughout the entire course. However, you can switch mentors if you want. - Multiple Break Options - Pause(s)/Freeze for when life gets abnormally busy or you need a break from the course. Both options push your deadline date. - 2 Live Code Reviews with mentors who are not your regular mentor - Really supportive student advisers, who can be an extra accountability point - Semi-weekly office hours (curriculum-related and general questions for student advisers as well) - recorded so you can reference whenever - There&#39;s a lot of material and you get so much practice with tons of projects and exercises with &quot;further study&quot; sections - 10 assessments that are reviewed by your mentor + 2 capstone projects - TAs are available via chat during normal business hours - Career office hours (go over topics related to resume, Linkedin, networking, etc.) - recorded so you can reference whenever - 8 career coach calls/check-ins - Placements team to help send job opportunities to your inbox closer to when you are completing the course (I believe this team was created in 2021) - They care a lot about their students - They ask for a lot of feedback from students and will make changes or improvements that make sense. - Everyone is so nice and supportive Cons: - Interview readiness: Interviewing was probably what I felt least prepared for at the end of the curriculum. If you are making the switch into software engineering, you need to know now that interviewing is a whole different ballgame than the actual job itself. Some software engineers go to interviewing bootcamps JUST to prepare for interviewing. It&#39;s one thing to know how to code and problem solve, but to also be able to talk through your thought process AND have your code work or have to figure out bugs in your code while someone is watching -- interviewing can be really stressful. I was super lucky because I have a software engineer friend that practiced with me every night for 1.5 months to help me prep for the MOCK interviews, and I ended up still not passing my first attempt at the coding mock interview (I think I had been practicing with my friend for a month already at that point). In addition to practicing with my friend, I even scheduled 1 practice mock interview with Springboard before attempting and ultimately passing my second official coding mock interview. FYI if you don&#39;t pass within 2 tries, you no longer qualify for the job guarantee - so at the time, it felt like high stakes to me. However, this shouldn&#39;t have been the focus (see Tips below). I also understand that not everyone has a friend that they can practice with every night and get valuable feedback (yes, I know she&#39;s a very good friend), so I think Springboard needs more support in this area where students can choose to practice with a live person however many times they want, in advance, to prepare for the coding and white-boarding mock interviews. - Pretty new curriculum, including policies and procedures: At least at the time that I started, they were still figuring out kinks/bugs in the curriculum so the exercises could change shortly after you do them (this happened to me) but there wouldn&#39;t be any notification about it. Now that they have hired more people, the communication is better about this sort of thing. While the changes can be annoying, this is also a good thing because that means they care about their curriculum and students and are always looking for ways to improve. They have also made a lot of updates and come out with new documentation around their policies and procedures. You as a student just need to go with the flow. - Every time you have a question or have a bug that you can&#39;t figure out, uploading your code to Google Drive or GitHub and then having to type out your issues/questions to the TA in a little chat box can be really annoying but this also gives you training on what it&#39;s like to work remotely - Although, I think in work settings, it&#39;s more likely that you would be able to have a quick meeting and share your screen. I know Springboard is trying to work on a solution to this, but this also isn&#39;t the end of the world. I can see that it&#39;s probably much easier to ask a question in person/be in a class setting for when you do have questions. - No new friends (at least for me): You don&#39;t really get to know your cohort that well unless you take initiative and be really social online - but to put it bluntly, I&#39;m older and I&#39;m not doing this to make friends haha. Everyone in my cohort/online did seem really nice and I knew people in my cohort who made individual study groups or paired up, but this just wasn&#39;t my thing ONLY because I already had a friend who was taking the UI/UX bootcamp with Springboard (she was probably ahead of me by 6 months) and we were each other&#39;s accountability buddies, and that was really helpful. Even after she graduated, we could keep each other accountable on her job search and my progress with Springboard. I understand that this is rare though so if you want to socialize and make study groups with your cohort, by all means, do that. Tips: - I&#39;m not sure if this is still the case, but when I enrolled they let us access the curriculum 2 weeks before our cohort start date, and the deadline to decide if you want a refund is 2 weeks after the cohort start date. This is basically 1 full month where you get access to the curriculum to try it out. If you&#39;re on the fence about choosing Springboard and you&#39;re not in a rush to do the bootcamp, enroll in a cohort date late enough so that you get this 1 month trial. - Keep in mind that the point is to NOT get a refund, the point is to get a job with your new awesome skills. - With self-pacing learning, it&#39;s important to stay disciplined but stay healthy. Stick to a schedule. Turn off distractions. Make sure to eat well, drink water, exercise, and get plenty of sleep. You can&#39;t perform your best if your health goes down the drain. This is for your mental health too. - Take breaks if you need them! - If you don&#39;t think the weekly 1:1 mentor calls are enough, get an accountability buddy - could be from your cohort or could be a friend. - Reach out to your student advisor because they are super helpful and can keep you accountable too. - Career changes are DIFFICULT! Find your &quot;why&quot; and remind yourself of it when you&#39;re feeling unmotivated. Or better yet, look at it every day or week. - Do your best. Don&#39;t give up. Keep a positive attitude. It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. If you fall down, get back up again.</p>",6/18/2021,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard

Although that lead to many hardships I could never have predicted, I always knew that I had the support of my mentor and the Springboard Team. My student advisor(s) were always very easy to talk to and get ahold of during these hardships. They allow for a couple of pauses that I definitely took advantage of as they allowed me to collect myself, take breaks, and be easy on myself. During these times, taking care of yourself first is of utmost importance. Some things that I wish I did more: -The Unlimited Mentor Calls. Specifically while completing my capstone project, there are so many aspects to starting and completing a whole UX Design for the first time. While my mentor provided so much feedback that allowed me to complete my projects with grace, a little more help would have been useful. Be prepared to find a lot of the curriculum to be easy &quot;searchable&quot; from google. While the content may not be hard to get access to, the way they organize it is beneficial for those who want an extra hand at learning UX from the comfort of their own home.

However, I think the 1:1 mentor calls, career coaching, projects that you get to put in your portfolio are worth it.

I can&#39;t say enough good things about the curriculum or the mentors. My talents were stretched and expanded in meaningful ways through the course, and the exercises were extremely helpful in building the knowledge base necessary for a career in UX. Springboard is mentor led, and the mentor who guided me through the end of the course was a great voice for insights into improving my portfolio and representing myself professionally. The industry design project internship gave me an opportunity to put these skills into real life practice and make measurable impact at a company. You can&#39;t ask for more than that in a six month program. The weak link in the chain is career services. During my stint, I had some great career service calls where invaluable advice was provided, a couple of middling calls where it seemed like the coach needed to go through a script, and a no-show. To me, this isn&#39;t a deal breaker. I&#39;ve been in the workforce for a decade now, and I know my strengths, my weaknesses, and how to represent them in the hiring process. UX-minded folks out of college, though, will want to be tenacious with advocating for themselves with job coaches. Again, there are really wonderful coaches on the Springboard roster.

Yes - but only if you have the time and money to invest. I come from a graphic design background, so transitioning to UX design was a long learning curve, but do-able. I was also supported by friends and family during this year, and was able to focus on it full time for half of the program. The nine-month program isn&#39;t laid out with an accurate time frame. Some early assignments took much longer than expected. Then at the end of the course there was no schedule for creating a portfolio or finishing mock interviews. So altogether it took me closer to a year to finish. I have type-B energy with type-A expectations for my work, so this was a good amount of time for me to learn. Some of the projects went well, while others felt poorly planned. I&#39;m so thankful the internship at the end of the program was a group project. It helped my confidence for interviews to work on a team. I also learned a lot about where I can continue improving as a designer. However, I know other people did not have a good experience. Speaking of community, the Slack community is overwhelming, but I&#39;m grateful for all the students who help give feedback on work. So a mixed blessing. The Student Advisors and mentors at Springboard are professional and helpful. My mentor conversations each week helped me stay grounded and on-track during the program. I think besides the internship at an actual company, the career assignments built into the course were also a big plus to my confidence going into the job market.

I also was sick for two weeks, so it is extremely doable to finish the course earlier than 6 months. I also really liked working with my mentor once a week.

277044,2021.0,False,Springboard's UX/UI Career Track helped me transition from Bartender to UX Designer,"<p>My experience with Springboard was overall really great. It is competitively priced and one of the longer boot camps out there (9 months). The self-paced model is definitely not for everyone, but it allowed me the flexibility I needed to continue working full-time as a bartender while learning UX and building my portfolio. The curriculum is compiled of articles created by Springboard and curated from around the internet, as well as exercises that build into capstones that can be utilized as portfolio projects. There are weekly calls with an industry professional mentor that help keep you on track and guide your learning. Additionally, there are periodic coaching calls to make sure your resume, portfolio, and social media are coming along with your course progress. This turned out to be a huge advantage as I had all the pieces to begin job hunting once I graduated. The mandatory mock interviews at the end of the course helped build my confidence and prepare me for the interview process, including salary negotiation, portfolio presentation, and whiteboard challenges- all of which I utilized in finalizing my offer. My experience with their customer service and student advising was always pleasant and prompt. One thing that really helped me get my offer was the IDP (Industry Design Project), where students are paired with a start-up and get the chance to work on real-life UX problems. From what I heard, this experience can vary depending on the company and team you are assigned to- for me it was monumental in gaining the necessary experience and having client-facing talking points during interviews. As previously mentioned, the self-paced model is not for everyone, and if you were to nitpick the curriculum, yes you could in theory find these articles on the web and teach yourself, but this model is good for those wanting a curated learning experience with real-life support. With the growing number of boot camps out there, I think it can be difficult to take the leap and jump in, and I recognize that there was a bit of luck that went into my success, but if you are curious about the field of UX and able to work hard to develop your portfolio, I think Springboard is worth looking into.</p>",5/13/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

That being said - it took me an entire year to finish (as I started a Master&#39;s in Statistics about halfway through), but spreading the coursework out over a long period of time and having time to process the concepts was invaluable. While I wouldn&#39;t say Springboard is an easy fix to get a job ASAP, it was incredibly transformative overall for my career and approach to learning in a positive way.

Mentors were very good and gave very strong technical feedbacks and advice for projects and make you think about what can be next.

276475,2020.0,False,Springboard UX/UI Bootcamp Completion,"<p>My experience with Springboard was extremely educational and balanced. Heading out into the working world, I feel prepared with all of the knowledge and tools that I need to stand out amidst the crowd and am confident I can find the job that I want. Overall I think Springboard is a wonderful program and well worth the time spent. However, it should be known that I found the estimated time to complete the course to be far from reality. I was told it would take 9 months at 3hrs/day of school work. However it took me close to a year at around 5-8 hours/day to complete all of the assignments. I think the timeline to complete the curriculum is dependent on several factors, including your mentor&#39;s dedication to your learning, the complexity of capstone projects you choose and your experience with design when entering into the program. In retrospect I would suggest anyone considering this course to expect to spend at least twice as much time getting through it. Additionally, it helps to have a base knowledge or working experience with design when starting the curriculum, though it&#39;s not necessary, it&#39;ll save you a lot of time. Lastly, the mentor you&#39;re paired with is crucial to your success. I was lucky that my mentor was willing to go above and beyond our weekly 30min call times. If it wasn&#39;t for my mentor taking more of a teaching role I would not have been as successful or feel as prepared as I do now. Though unlimited mentor calls are available, it is difficult to receive consistent and actionable feedback from multiple people who haven&#39;t been following your learning process from the beginning.

But once you start the capstone projects, it all seems to be very helpful in the project. 1:1 mentor call was the major thing I chose this course in Springboard over other boot camps available for UX design. Also, unlimited mentor call availability was very helpful during capstone projects and presentation preparation. Follow all the steps and trust the process. Prior to joining Springboard, I didn&#39;t know how to approach recruiters and talk to them.

276187,2021.0,False,"The one-on-one mentorship programs is amazing, but the curriculum can feel a bit disjointed at times.","<p>Springboard is one of the more affordable data science bootcamps ($7500 upfront cost, compared to $10k or even $18k in some other bootcamps). They&#39;re able to do this by not having in-person lecturers. The curriculum is completely online, self-paced. Much of the curriculum is actually videos and articles from other online resources (see &quot;Cons&quot; below). But they make up for this by their mentorship program (see &quot;Pros&quot; below). On the surface, this looks like a really good deal--it&#39;s cheaper than other bootcamps, it&#39;s self-paced, and you get a tuition refund guarantee if you don&#39;t find a job within 6 months of graduating. However, in practice, when you have a 6-month deadline (instead of in-person classes with an instructor to keep you accountable on a daily basis), it can be really easy to fall behind. Fortunately Springboard has a number of student advisors and other support staff who can help with setting a schedule for you to follow and giving you extensions (both of which I&#39;ve used). But I think the people who can best thrive in this kind of program are those who can set clear goals for themselves on a weekly basis, in spite of all the other things going on in their lives. I had a lot of trouble balancing my bootcamp assignments with my daytime job and family obligations (your job and familial needs will feel very immediate while the bootcamp feels less urgent because of the 6-month deadline), and I quickly fell behind and needed extensions. This might all sound very obvious, but it&#39;s something that I and others I know often overlook. If you&#39;re not the kind of person to set hard deadlines for yourself, don&#39;t do a self-paced bootcamp. But if you are, and you don&#39;t mind not having an in-person instructor, then Springboard is for you. Pros: The mentorship program is the highlight of this bootcamp. Every student is matched with a mentor who they meet with once per week, 30 minutes at a time. You can also schedule additional unlimited 1:1 mentor calls with any mentor that&#39;s available, but I&#39;ve found my weekly mentor to be the biggest help. I was able to ask my mentor for guidance on capstone projects, discuss questions I had about the mathematics behind certain algorithms, and ask for career advice (they are people in the industry, so they have insight on the field and job searches and whatnot). Springboard also has career coaches to help us with job searches, but it&#39;s still helpful to hear directly from the mouth of a person in the industry. Cons: Much of the curriculum is material that you can find on your own online (like articles on medium.com). Springboard organizes it all into a nice package for you, with many of their own project assignments sprinkled throughout, but this can make some of the material feel disjointed since it&#39;s a conglomeration of many different sources put together. Springboard goes through many updates with their curriculum though, so they&#39;ve been making improvements to their assignments and curricula. To sum it up: you get what you pay for; Springboard is one of the more affordable bootcamps, but they&#39;re able to keep the price low by not building their whole curriculum from scratch and instead using other resources already available on the web.</p>",4/20/2021,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

My mentor was particularly amazing (gave thoughtful, expert, challenging, and encouraging feedback), which made every penny worth the course. I hear most mentors are great, though I&#39;m sure experiences can vary a bit. Career coaching has been fantastic across the board. Cons: My main small complaint about the course is that most sub-projects are still fairly large/involved, but there&#39;s not much bite-sized practice beforehand. Everything (for the most part) goes straight into the capstone (until the next big project). Since the capstone will be displayed in the portfolio, it can be easy to spend inordinate amounts of time working on (and stressing about) making the very first attempt at each assignment &quot;perfect,&quot; or &quot;impressive.&quot; Recommendation: Schedule at least one extra mentor call each week, whether you have questions or not.

Weekly calls with a mentor are very helpful in checking up on progress and making sure any questions you have along the way get addressed. My mentor was very knowledgeable and thorough in his explanations of any questions I had. I found the projects and assignments more helpful than the videos.

275677,2021.0,False,A great way to springboard myself into the industry,"<p>After graduating from University, I realized that it was time to switch careers. Yes, I did not enjoy what I was doing in university but it&#39;s never too early or late to switch into something I&#39;m passionate about. The pros: The 1:1 mentorship call was the deciding factor to why I chose Springboard over other bootcamps. I have always wanted to have someone guide me and become my mentor. The 1:1 calls helped me learn so much from the perspective of an experienced designer. He pushed, challenged, and guided me to being the designer I am today. Without the help of a mentor, I would&#39;ve struggled. All of my questions about design were answered by my mentor and now it&#39;s engrained into me. The Springboard community (people who work there aka. community managers, career coaches, and student advisors) are very supportive and is always wishing the best for you. I learnt so much within 6-7 months. The cons: In the very beginning, I underestimated the amount of work that would go into this program. It took a lot out of me and there were multiple times I burned out. I put a lot of importance in the Industry Design Program and I was disappointed. Most companies that you get matched up with probably would not use your designs at the end (I know some students have had their designs implemented). This all comes down to the company as most do not have the financial budget to hire someone to implement your designs. But maybe they will in the future. Besides the IDP, I noticed that sometimes the Springboard community of other students communicating with each other is quite dead silent. People in the beginning were very active and now it&#39;s like there are crickets in some channels. Overall, I would recommend Springboard as they do a great job preparing you to become a designer and to find a job! Other programs don&#39;t seem to stress the job phase as much as Springboard and I love how it gets me out of my comfort zone.</p>",4/9/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Springboard provided a company through which I was able to start an internship that has the potential of turning into a future employment opportunity which has been really nice. My mentor was very helpful and provided great feedback in our weekly calls. The curriculum was a little light on the &#39;UI&#39; portion of the UX / UI Design program which was sort of disappointing. Other than that, everyone that I have interacted with at Springboard has been very helpful and knowledgeable. I completed this program with an average of around 30 hours a week in 6 months.

275590,2020.0,False,"Former English Teacher, Humanities Undergrad, Now Employed in Data Role","<p>I enrolled in Springboard&rsquo;s Data Analytics Career Track upon completing a two-year contract with Teach For America. I always had an interest in data but never felt confident in acting on it until I had to figure out my next step after teaching. I studied international relations and communication/writing in my undergraduate career so had no formal quantitative experience upon applying. From the moment I applied to Springboard, everything was incredibly professional and straightforward. In fact, after submitting my application, a recruiter called me within 5 minutes to talk about my interest - completely opposite of another boot camp I was considering who didn&rsquo;t even contact me despite confirming an appointment. This quickness made me think they were desperate, but the recruiter wasn&rsquo;t pushy but friendly and even gave me an informal interview to make sure I was someone who really wanted to sign up. After that call, I was required to take a roughly one-hour long quantitative aptitude test to further verify that data analytics was a path I could reasonably pursue. I mention this because I was worried that I would fall trap to simply enrolling into a program that took anyone and everyone who signed up. In truth, I&rsquo;m not sure if they decline students from enrolling either way, but I felt confident that this interview and assessment were evidence that they were at least slightly selective in their admissions process. Curriculum The curriculum is mostly a curation of online resources. These resources come from YouTube videos, articles, and other websites related to business and data analytics. A couple of units are specifically dedicated to business education like economics, financial analysis, statistics, accounting, and other business fundamentals. The cycle of the projects also follows that of a typical data analyst workflow, somewhat similar to the scientific method in crafting a hypothesis, gathering data, exploration, etc. I found these concepts helpful as I was someone who steered away from anything business-related up to that point; I simply had no interest back then. Most of the projects simulate a real-world project utilizing the things you learned earlier in the unit. These are not typically from online resources and are created by Springboard. Given that I don&rsquo;t have real-world experience with these kinds of projects, it&rsquo;s hard for me to stack them up against practicality, but they tended to help structure my capstone projects which require you to make up your own project and find the data for it, so it was helpful in that regard. Otherwise, sometimes the projects were poorly worded and it could be slightly cumbersome in finding out exactly what you were supposed to do. But these were usually minor and you could always clarify with your mentor or other students about the assignments and get clarification. They also release new versions of the curriculum to improve a particular assignment, section, or even whole unit based on student feedback so they really try to be responsive to what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not for students. Towards the final stages of the curriculum, you&rsquo;re required to do a series of interviews that would mimic a real interview you would get. For example, you do a behavioral interview, a presentation interview in which you create a presentation from a project in the course and give that presentation as if you were &ldquo;working&rdquo; for the organization, and a technical interview in which they ask you questions about statistics, business, SQL, or whatever else might come up in a real technical interview. Your career coach helps you prepare for these, mostly the behavioral ones as they aren&rsquo;t data specialists themselves but you can also do preparation with your mentor to prepare for these. They are pass/fail. You&rsquo;re given a couple of opportunities to pass it but if you fail too many times then you have to redo a couple of units I believe. At first, I found this kind of scary, but the pressure it adds to those interviews is really helpful in simulating what it will be like when you&rsquo;re doing real interviews. They tend to be anxiety-inducing, you&rsquo;ll be nervous, and the stakes are higher. The fact that they try to build this pressure into these mock interviews was pretty cool now that I reflect on it. At the time I didn&rsquo;t think it was that cool! But if you&rsquo;re someone who struggles with interviews, these mock runs are helpful not only in getting practice but also feedback from those interviewers. They go into detail about how you could do better or other things to think about when you get to a real interview. Mentors and Community Each student is assigned a mentor who is a data analyst/scientist in the field. You have weekly calls with them and they&rsquo;re mostly there to guide you through the curriculum but you can always talk to them about other things like job searching or how they use tools/techniques in their own jobs, etc; at least my mentor was open to talking about whatever. I hadn&rsquo;t ever come across anyone who had a bad experience with their mentor, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist. My mentor was incredibly relaxed, easy to talk to, and helpful when I needed help in the curriculum or needed encouragement on something I found difficult. One thing that made me like my mentor more was also his ability to sometimes question minor details in the curriculum. I appreciate someone who can point out weaknesses in something even though they&rsquo;re part of the organization itself. It let me know that this person I was assigned to by Springboard wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a 100% kool-aid drinking member of the club, but an independent person who, though still agreed the curriculum was a good one, was capable of sometimes saying &ldquo;well I&rsquo;m not sure I would do it that way but it&rsquo;s valid.&rdquo; Upon being accepted into the program, you are also invited to the Slack channel for your specific course. This is where you can communicate with other students in the course who are all at different stages of the curriculum, though you do have a channel for people who are in your specific cohort. There are also Springboard faculty in the channel as well, including a person who helped write the curriculum. They are really helpful in clarifying kinks in assignments or helping students who are having a difficult time on something. There are also various channels for different types of things like job searching, motivation, resources, recorded lectures, and all types of things. Throughout the curriculum, you also have career units in which you learn strategies about job searching. You&rsquo;re also allowed to choose a career coach, who appears to be contracted with Springboard (I could be wrong about this) to provide 30-minute coaching sessions. These range from resume critiques, to mock interviews, to general strategies, to sharing resources, and really anything that they feel would be helpful to you. You also aren&rsquo;t required to stick with one career coach, you can always select from a whole list of people at any point and they have descriptions of their background to give you a sense of what to expect. I stuck with the same one the entire time because I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to talk to a different coach. The Job Search The job search process was not a totally pleasant one, as anyone who has gone through it can attest. But my career coach and the Springboard community in Slack were really helpful. You could see where other people were struggling as well and my career coach would always give helpful suggestions or resources to help in my search. I applied to a little over 90 jobs and had 3 total interviews. Again, I don&rsquo;t have any kind of formal background in data, business, or STEM besides the Springboard certificate and some projects to showcase my aptitude, so I felt that that was a bit of a barrier for me. Despite this, I did get a job! A friend of my partner referred me to a role at her company which landed me the interview. My career coach did a mock interview with me, reviewed Google Docs that I drafted interview responses to, and answered any other questions I had during the process. I can honestly say my experience in the boot camp really gave me a leg up. They loved that I had that experience and projects to show for it. During the final round of interviews for this role, I had a technical assessment and didn&rsquo;t do too hot on it, but I was able to redeem myself by talking intelligently about my projects in the course. I think this made me come across as someone who understood general concepts and use cases for specific things and even if I lagged on the technical assessment, I was someone who could get better quickly. My title isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;data analyst&rdquo; but &ldquo;marketing specialist.&rdquo; Much of the role is data related though and even though some of it isn&rsquo;t, it allows me to use skills that I&rsquo;ve built over the years in undergrad and as a teacher so I&rsquo;m not 100% shifted into a totally new technical profession. The other roles I interviewed for were pure data analyst jobs though. I made it to either the final or next to final rounds in those interviews and made some mistakes that I think cost me the job. You learn from these though, and your career coach will help you diagnose what happened and how you can do better the next time. I finished the course in mid-November and just recently got a job offer on March 29, so a little over 4 months after completing the course. Another cool thing that Springboard offers is post-completion assistance. You&rsquo;re allowed to meet with another mentor who can help you be accountable for keeping your skills alive and building more projects to showcase to prospective employers. You have access to this mentor until you get a job and can be really helpful when you complete the course and then start to find that your skills are slipping. A Potential Downside One potential downside to this track might be the curriculum. Though this downside is innate in the way the course is structured. It&rsquo;s set up as a part-time, 6-month learning experience. They want you to get familiar with a wide range of tools that you could potentially use in a data analyst job, mostly the more popular ones as there are TONS of tools that you could potentially use in the field. In this regard, there&rsquo;s more breadth than depth in the things you&rsquo;ll learn. They are still helpful. After a unit and a project, you can honestly say that you&rsquo;re proficient in that tool or concept. You&rsquo;ll also learn that each tool could be its own 6-month course. If you haven&rsquo;t used Microsoft Excel professionally before, or maybe you have, you find out that Excel is more powerful than what you were familiar with. This was the case for me anyway. I&rsquo;m not sure that any boot camp can really overcome this downside though when the curriculum itself is designed to be completed in a relatively short period of time. You might become interested in diving deeper into a tool after completing a unit on it, but have to move on to the next tool introduced in the next unit. This is just part of being in tech. I recommend seeking other online resources if you become really interested in getting better at a particular tool. However, I still believe, along with many other practitioners, that the curriculum is still helpful in allowing you to understand the essentials and then get a job with them. In Conclusion I think the number one thing that you get out of the course is structure and community. Of course, you could learn everything in any boot camp online for free, but you to be someone who can muster the discipline and structure to stick to it long-term. I have a habit of constantly looking for new resources to learn from, even after finding what seems like a good one, I&rsquo;ll complete half of it and then start looking for something else. Springboard&rsquo;s curriculum allowed me to stay on course and I trusted that what they put in front of me was going to be helpful in learning and ultimately getting a job. The frequent connection with my mentors, career coach, and other students was really helpful in knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t alone. It gave me a psychological edge in that someone I was meeting with at the end of the week was expecting me to complete assignments and be able to discuss them. This was a total career pivot for me and, so far, I&rsquo;m glad that I did it.

My experience was very interesting and challenging. Please see below some points why I really love this program: 1. The curriculum has a good structure and It covers the main topics for data analytics (Financial Analysis, Economics, Statistics, Career Coaching) and such important analytical tools as SQL, Python, Advanced Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. 2. The Springboard mentors are very professional and supportive. 3. You will never feel alone with the useful Slack channel and weekly meetings. 4. Communication with the student advisers and the Springboard support team was good and very helpful as well. 5. The program is flexible, and it is possible to balance effectively between your current job and the course. 6. You can take 3 weeks break if you need to pause the program. 7. The price is much lower than the prices of other bootcamps. 8. You can get a discount if you refer your friends (as I did!). 9. At the end of the program, you will have two capstones projects and you will be able to tell your &ldquo;story&rdquo; and be prepared well for the real interview. 10. After the program you have 6-months of support from the career coach to help you to apply for the roles and pass the interview. I can definitely recommend the Springboard Data Analytics Career Track program. It worth the money and benefit you as a data analyst professional. Thank you.

I can&#39;t imagine having learned all this without this guidance and without my mentor. In fact I am sure I never would have. I would have putzed around in this corner and that corner of the internet and never really mastered anything. But I DID take the course and I am amazed at ehat I have accomplished. The absolute best part of the program was the mentor experience. My mentor pulled me out of the depths of despair countless times and gave me clear guidance on how to get back on track. Her technical guidance was also top notch. The curriculum was very broad and deep and at times felt like too much, but I appreciate that was well.

Since I was a full-time student, I was able to complete the course in 7 months using the monthly payment selection. You also have a opportunity to complete a real-world internship with a company, which is pretty cool if you have no design experience.

The curriculum is of high quality and taught by an inspiring instructor who makes difficult concepts easy to understand. The only issue I ran into was communication within project guidelines and &quot;commonly asked questions.&quot; By the time I emailed my student advisor to verify my understanding, a month and a half had passed.

274530,2021.0,False,Excellent Curriculum,"<p>The thing I benefitted the most from my time at Springboard was its strong curriculum. We learned two prominent backend frameworks (Flask/Python and Express/NodeJS) and React for the front end. Learning the two programming languages Springboard covers really helped me understand how languages can differ but also just how similar they are. The instructor for the course is Colt Steele - and I believe he is one of the biggest reasons I enjoyed the course so much. He has a few free courses on Udemy and youtube so you can see there if his teaching style matches with how you learn. With regards to the career services, they do help you a lot and offer advice/best practices for how to succeed in your job search but ultimately it is up to you to find a job. This goes for all bootcamps. Still, it&#39;s great to have professional guidance for building your resume, reaching out to people on LinkedIn, etc. The downside I noticed with Springboard was that the assignments at the end of the unit could benefit from clearer instructions. This has been brought up to them and improvements to the assignment instructions for the later cohorts have been made.

Springboard is one of the leading online boot camps, and while it is not the least expensive of the programs, I joined because it is more than just a UX/UI boot camp. They include in their course curriculum mentors with real UX professionals and career coaches, who not only help you develop the skills to become a UX/UI Designer but they work on all the other aspects needed to get a job; eg. network training, linked-in profiles, resumes, interviewing, etc. On top of that, they have a job placement program that helps you get a job once your course is completed. Because this is a self-directed online learning course, I would not recommend this course, if you are not able to motivate yourself to stay on track and on schedule. There is a lot of work and if you do not have the discipline to consistently complete the course work, this is not for you.

I learned a lot and all of the mentors are UX professionals themselves so they are full of wonderful insight into the process and profession Cons - Easy to get a bit off track with their timeline especially when you get to the design portions. Prepare to spend more time on certain project assignments to really make it stand out. Their recommended number of hours to complete units is based on what an average student would spend (roughly C+/B- work in my opinion) - Since your mentor will most likely be a working professional, they aren&#39;t always as responsive with replying to emails and also they most likely have up to 4 other mentees. So being able to self-direct and make design decisions is important. Plus, if you want to finish the course earlier than your track, your mentor might not be able to go over all of your assignments in the weekly 30 min call.

274394,2021.0,False,Rewarding and definitely worth the investment!,"<p>I was initially thinking about going to graduate school vs taking bootcamp course and after researching for 3 months, I finally decided to go for the second option. The next was deciding on which bootcamp to sign up for since I&#39;ve never taken online courses and there were way too many options out there. I did another 2 months of research and decided to go with Springboard because of three reasons: a self-paced curriculum for me to create a solid UX portfolio, 1:1 mentorship, and 6-month job guarantee policy. Looking back, I can confidently say that I&#39;m happy with the choices I&#39;ve made!

They say you can finish UI/UX career track in 9 months but I think that only applies to full-time students. For me, I was working full-time and studying part-time so it took me about a year to finish! And I found myself studying most of my weekends, PTOs, summer fridays, after work hours (from 9 pm-4 am).

Cons: as with any other online education, can be lonely at times, and at times you feel the lack of working in a group and hearing others&#39; ideas. But students can take initiative to set up study groups. Since curriculum is broad and covers many different topics in world of data science, many of which are changing quickly as technologies change, the curriculum constantly needs updating which is tough to keep on top of. There are, however, mechanisms to provide feedback on curriculum, and the Slack community is always super helpful.

274305,2021.0,False,"The mentors are wonderful, and make the program.","<p>In searching for the right Data Science bootcamp, mentorship was the most important element to me: I needed to connect with someone who was able to help me master coding, thinking in data science, and the cutting-edge innovations happening in the field, while bearing in mind my background in philosophy and interest in AI Ethics: Rigor in the field, plus a way to tie it to the mental model I already had about the world. I was lucky to have found a mentor (Ben!) who did exactly that in my time at Springboard. Especially great, too, is their unlimited mentors option -- a half hour/day, every day, for the entire time you&#39;re part of the program. I used that liberally to cover the gaps, ask deeper questions, and find resources that were off-curriculum. Springboard&#39;s curriculum is mostly public-domain, and I appreciated most of the resources they provided. DataCamp isn&#39;t very helpful to learning to code, in the end (try learning French only by being given full sentences, with a single word missing in each sentence you have to fill in -- not gonna happen). The notebooks they provided were mostly good. Sometimes they were unhelpful to learning this or that concept, although the team was rapid to help out. Here&#39;s my recommendation to Springboard: Give the option for students to do e.g. four capstones after Unit 6 (the guided capstone they have us do), rather than walk through the whole curriculum. If they opt to do four capstones, make the rest of the curriculum optional -- they&#39;d simply be resources to help students out on their capstones. The capstones would then have to be approach-specific, e.g. do a capstone that works with a time series, or NLP, in order to get credit for the capstone. I suggest this because I find that I learned a LOT when I worked on my capstones, because they related to topics I cared about, and sincerely wanted to understand -- more, in fact, than I ever did plodding through DataCamp or lectures that didn&#39;t necessarily interest me. I think that&#39;d also be better for student portfolios -- it shows they&#39;re self-motivated and can actively produce multiple projects on a diverse array of subjects/problems within Data Science. Just my two cents. IMO it&#39;s an idea worth piloting. I didn&#39;t graduate through their job guarantee (or get a job ultimately related to data science), so I&#39;ve left the &quot;Job Support&quot; section blank.

The virtual platform also allows you to connect with people all over the country and all over the world and allows you to choose your hours, so you don&#39;t have to quit your day job (but you always can if you want to!) - career services available throughout the course, not just at the end when you&#39;ve finished everything. There are actionable career- related projects to work on alongside coding projects and homework - TAs are available online via chat and email, it helps with going through a virtual course so you don&#39;t get stuck forever - I personally really enjoyed the curriculum. The videos explained concepts well and the assignments, while challenging, would implement recently learned concepts. Video lectures are also pretty short and it&#39;s nice to be able to watch a concept get broken down into 10 5-minute videos vs. 1-2 20-30-minute videos. I appreciated that a lot of the homework built off of existing infrastructure (e.g. if you&#39;re doing a back-end assignment, front-end files would be ready to import). There were plenty of handouts summarizing concepts as well. - mock interviews are conducted throughout and at the end of the course with other mentors/industry professionals. It&#39;s great to get critical feedback from others in the industry. - job support post-course-completion includes career coach calls to keep you on task and improving. Cons: - virtual. No classroom so you better be motivated or find ways to keep going. - there could be more curriculum coverage on Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, but the curriculum does have a good basic introduction to those.

Springboard will make you first of all understand the business aspect of Data Science before bringing you into the technical aspect.

I would also say SB is very open to anything you need or questions you have, and the mentors have a lot of availability. Their goal is to help you finish the course as well, so you don&#39;t have to feel like anything is holding you back.

Know if you need in depth help: customer service is a disconnected set of customer reps and a new person helps you each time. So every time you email them, someone else replies and if it isn&#39;t solved in first go, you need to repeat yourself. That will be a bigger deal if you need a whole bootcamp. The mentor was very encouraging and helpful he was definitely my favorite part of this course. Glad to have connected to him because he gave some stellar resources including free code camp site which taught me in lieu of this useless program. The curriculum was no short of an unhelpful trainwreck. The narrator speaks fluently with industry jargon, explains none of it, talks and does the tasks within the videos very quickly. If you want to follow along there is constant pausing that becomes cumbersome and annoying. Some of the topics are so disconnected and dry that you can definitely use it cure insomnia. He doesn&#39;t really tell you what or why you are doing the tasks, most of it looks like random junky exercises that have no real world connection so I have a hard time understanding how it would even connect to the design itself. He simply isn&#39;t a teacher. He is a quintessential tech bro that is recording himself talk and giggling at his own jokes, rattling off phrases about things you ought to know but didn&#39;t teach. The intros are random phrases strung together of rules sets with no terms of definitions.

I was skeptical, however, since this was the first for-profit school that I had attended. I expected the school to provide me with the resources promised and nothing more. However, I discovered that Springboard far exceeded my expectations by treating and supporting me as a holistic human. COVID was tougher on me than I expected, and I was not as motivated throughout the duration of the program as I expected (initially, I wanted to complete my program in 3 months). Springboard had systems in place to keep me (and EVERY student) from falling through the cracks. This is something I never discovered in my public schooling (high school and even my bachelor&#39;s).

I only have one criticism and if they were to fix it, then I&#39;d rate it 10/10. They require students to finish practice interviews, behavioral, whiteboard, project, and technical, and only allow you 2 attempts before you&#39;re disqualified for the job guarantee.

272763,2020.0,False,Great remote option,"<p>I attended Springboard from March till November of 2020, and it was a great alternative to live classes. Pros: You get to meet with your personal design mentor once a week for 30 minutes to provide feedback on assignments, career coach for 30 min, and you can book unlimited support sessions with other UX mentors - so potentially you&#39;re looking at 3 live sessions a week which is super helpful. All professionals I encountered were knowledgeable and able to answer my questions. There is also a slack channel for students. You get to complete 3 projects altogether and walk away with a solid portfolio! Cons: They don&#39;t have their own pre-recorded curriculum, rather, it&#39;s a bunch of links to existing articles or videos posted on the internet that follow UX design cycle and explain all the key concepts. Some of the links are 2-3 years old and might not be as relevant. Also, the course takes more than 6 months to complete for a vast majority of students (they do provide a free extension). Conclusion: the program was both useful and interesting but is probably most suitable for someone who has some prior experience in psychology, art&amp; design, or tech. I got UX contract job shortly after graduation but I already did have several years of work experience in the arts/media.</p>",1/24/2021,UX Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Only drawbacks are that I feel like it was not emphasized that if you fail any of the mock interviews twice, you do not get the job guarantee. I came to this realization when I started doing the mock interviews at the end. Could be a determining factor in signing up for some people. Also, the mock interviewers need to follow the rubric for the mock interviews more strictly.

I recommend reaching out to someone on the Springboard team to get more information and talk about if this is the best option for you. Springboard&#39;s curriculum has equipped me well and given me the experience I need to begin my job search in this industry. Springboard also pairs you up with a real-life client as part of your last project and I believe that to be super valuable. Not only was I able to apply the design skills that I&#39;ve learned throughout the course, but I was able to get real-life work experience and have a valuable project to add to my personal portfolio.

Now although I had 3 years of schooling in Design I felt like the projects I was given didn&#39;t provide me with the real-life experience I needed to enter the industry with confidence. After researching various bootcamps I felt that Springboard provided the best option for the best cost. I ended up signing up for the UI/UX course because it contained an emphasis in not only visual design but also in user research and user experience. I wanted to make sure that when I completed my certification that not only would it provide me with some valuable portfolio pieces but that it would help me feel comfortable applying for a job in the field post graduation. Overall, this course exceeded my expectations the mentors were amazing and provided me with some very valuable feedback whether that was related to various assignments or career advice. As some who went to a university and has a degree in Design I don&#39;t think I would have gained the same experience and knowledge I gained from Springboard at school.

Moreover weekly one to one mentor calls, truly motivate you complete the weeks curriculum in order to present/ discuss with your mentor. Springboard also offers a Job Guarantee program to all eligible students, with the best of the best career coaches to guide you find you dream job. What I liked most was the flow of curriculum.

Even though it&#39;s designed to be a 6-month program, for students with relevant experience, they can speed up their learning and complete the course within 3-4 months as it&#39;s self-paced. I was able to complete the course in 3 months, as the mentors and student advisors were very responsive whenever you have questions (they have many mentors available besides the 1:1 mentor assigned to you). The career service from Springboard is overall very effective as well since most of the career coaches are professional technical recruiters and have been in the field for many years - I&#39;ve worked with 3 career coaches, they are all very strategic in terms of resume writing and interview preparation. I was able to receive 2-3 times more interview invitations since I joined the program. The 1:1 mentorship is definitely the primary value of the program.

I also liked that there was a focus on supporting you as you looked for work. After being accepted into the UX Design Career Track program, my first month or two were pretty easy. I had already taken a few UX courses, so the early parts felt like a refresher, and I felt like I was just getting deeper into the details - which I liked. Then came the middle part of the course. The curriculum is thorough and rigorous, and I felt overwhelmed at times with the amount of work that had to be done in the time period. Obviously doing this all during a pandemic and upheaval of 2020 wasn&#39;t easy, but Springboard was excellent about flexibility. I ended up taking a 3 week pause. 1 week off, and 2 weeks to catch up. My 6 months class ended up being more like 8 months, including the internship, which was extremely valuable. Overall, I feel extremely prepared for the job I have now, and I love that I still have access to my curriculum in case I need to remember something. The best part of the course is the mentorship. My mentor gave me such valuable feedback, and really put the entire process in perspective for me.

I struggled initially due to some personal issues, and he inspired and encouraged me to continue with the course, even when I fell behind. With his support and the support of Springboard&#39;s career coaches, I graduated this past month. (With a completed resume and portfolio website to boot!)

But then in the Economics and Financial units, there were some videos we needed to watch, that I felt like were not in the level of what Springboard had so far. I think I was mostly frustrated about DataCamp. I did not feel like I&#39;ve learned too much from it, and needed to find other sources to study from. The mentors (my mentor and the mentor on call) and the career coach I worked with were very professional, and I&#39;ve learned a lot from them. Even thought the content was sometimes not to what I&#39;ve expected, I found the overall experience very positive.

The connections I have made have been so invaluable to my growth as a person that my confidence in my ability to succeed has bolstered by the person I have become.

It is self-paced and convenient for those who are trying to learn with other time constraints. The statistics methodology is sound and concise. It was the perfect complement and review to my Quantative Analysis MBA class and Linear Optimization class. Springboard teaches the fundamentals, but students must take the initiative after the course to continually practice and learn to handle exceptions that were not covered in the course. The course focuses on analyzing data once it is cleaned, but data cleaning techniques are necessary to be successful in the industry if you&#39;re not given a clean dataset by a data scientist or a data engineer. I became more confident and learned more after internships with data that required mining and cleaning than simply by focusing on concepts in class. If Springboard incorporates an internship, then it would be excellent! The mentors come from the industry and have worked at major companies like Hewlett Packard. Career coaches have worked in a variety of industries as recruiters. So, their advice can be helpful. Everyone wants you to succeed. So, it was a positive experience.

There is no doubt that I have leveled-up my skills as a designer, and have increased my value to teams--it follows that there is a sizable pay increase for the types of roles I am now qualified to fill. Coming into the bootcamp, I made it clear that there would only be value on my investment if I created good work, honed marketable skills and took it upon myself to work as hard as I can to create good work and get noticed. I think it&#39;s important to understand that your bootcamp alone is not going to land you a job. The effectiveness of your work will get you noticed, and your work with career advisers to ace interviews alongside finding an awesome culture fit and industry you can get excited about will combine to land you a role. I have heard this in multiple job interviews, that the reason I&#39;m in the interview is because of the quality work in comparison to other bootcamp grads who don&#39;t have a design background. This is especially true if you&#39;re into UI, less so for UX. I do feel the curriculum and the projects set students up to create the right types of work to get hired. As a designer, I brought a healthy amount of design skills to the program, and I think that really helps throughout the course and job hunt. I do feel it was more challenging for fellow students without a design background to cram design skills into their work while learning the value of UX. The most valuable project is your Industry project, where you&#39;ll be matched with a company to help them solve some UI/UX issues--this is really valuable and acts as an internship inside your bootcamp. I really loved my industry team and felt it added a good project to my portfolio. I had a great mentor who offered really fair and measured advice. She also creates her own content and has an awesome portfolio with large brands, so I immediately felt that lent to the value of the course. Overall, Springboard launched some great opportunities for me, and I would recommend it for students in design and/or students who wouldn&#39;t mind working a bit harder to learn design basics to then apply to their UX work</p>",1/9/2021,UI/UX Design Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

My main priority was also not just the course material but would I be taught the things that are necessary in a working environment. That&#39;s when I started researching about Courses and came across Springboard. Of all the courses I listed down, Springboard was the most flexible I could find to fit into my schedule. Initially it was just the basic/Foundation of UX. But as I went deeper and deeper, I felt like I was studying and managing a project in a working environment. At the end, I got the opportunity to do a project in a proper company and get the feel of utilising what I learnt in the course to solve a real-life company problem. I have to admit, despite doing the huge capstone, I was still scared, wondering What If I am not able to solve their problem or what If I do things that might be embarrassing. But the mentors and student advisors were there every step of the way calming my rapidly beating heart. But once I got into the company, things just came out smoothly, that&#39;s when I truly started appreciating the course on how well it prepared me to do this job, and thoroughly enjoying it during the process. All this I was able to do while having a baby and taking care of him afterwards. That&#39;s another reason I am glad I chose Springboard. Once I became pregnant after the course, I had only 6 months time to finish it, but I was gonna have a baby and everything. Thats when I reached out to Springboard telling them my concerns. Not only did they take my situation into consideration, but understood my predicament, and tailored the course around my schedule so that I may complete the course and start applying for a job. They told me, they understand how difficult it would be for a person who is having a baby, take care of them, and come back into the job market. Which is why, they would like to help me in anyway to prepare me to get a job. For that I am filled with gratitude.

BUT there are many mentors, students, and advisors ready to help or fix such things as you come across them. I researched many courses before deciding on Springboard. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a better price for the support and education you get from them. I am actually confident I will get a job as a data analyst because of Springboard.

We also had calls with a career coach who helped with tailoring portfolio, resume, guided for networking, behavioral interview and many more to get ready for the interviews. We also had office hours for general Data Science and career services. I had great experience with my student Advisor, who was very understanding, flexible and granted me several course breaks when I needed one.

However, when COVID came about, they moved their entire course online, and didn&#39;t alter the 12,000 tuition. I wasn&#39;t sure how prepared UCI would be to conduct remote classes, and if they would be able to offer the same value as if it had been in person. When I called them, I received no change in the tuition for a fully remote course, and little help.

This may seem counterproductive, but in the long term, one realizes that the organization of the work has been designed to maximize the assimilation of knowledge - everything has been distributed according to a precise agenda, which presents successive objectives in the same way as a game (with progress bar, etc). Following your own progress week after week, taking a review each time with your mentor is fun, exciting and above all very effective. You find yourself absorbing a significant amount of knowledge in a very short period of time. Just be warned that the UX / UI course is quite dense, and should not be taken lightly. The training is well worth the investment if you do it seriously. Last precision : I think that the courses proposed by Springboard are mostly valued in the United States.

271302,2020.0,True,Misleading,"While the course is good, they do hide many things which is why I am reviewing it so poorly. They recommend a prep course for the larger, more in depth courses, which cost money. That's fine however, since after you take the prep course, they subtract the prep course from the main course. Seems legit, right? Well that's only if you have a bachelors degree in the same field, but that of course is in the small print and is very misleading by their advertisement. So that was $500 down the drain. 

Next I apply for their Data Science Career Track Course, which I had to take a test to get into to show that I at least have some basic knowledge.  So I take the test, pass, enroll. Now I'm taking the first part of the course, about 20 hours into the coursework and it is basically the prep course all over, yet I have to pass it all to get the certificate. 

That's fine though because they have the ""job guarantee"" and that's why I chose Springboard over the other choices. I applied and am accepted into their course, then a week or two later I pay for the course, a whopping $7500, though if I'm guaranteed a job, that's well worth it! This is where the sneaky fine print comes in again... The nearly two weeks in between being accepted and paying, they could have called me to talk about the ""job guarantee, but waited until after I paid. So they call me the day that I pay and let me know that since, again, I don't have my bachelors degree in Data Science that I'm not qualified for the job guarantee.

So now here I am, I paid $8000 for something that's not even guaranteed where I could have just taken free courses from Udemy.com and accomplished the same thing.

More than just the curriculum, what I found very helpful is the job search support. Of course, I could not speak that much since I have not found a job as DS yet, but I do feel like it's helpful. Instead of just blindly applying for jobs posted on job boards, I was taught more methodically profound approach (which hopefully I can testify with a success in the near future).

The cons - it's quite overwhelming. Unless you have DS background or similar, you would need to work hard to get as much as possible from this program. For me personally, it was quite too much at times. I allocated times after finishing the program to actually review / relearning data science from other articles to sharpen my data science skills.

Great timing for a career change, I know...
I studied the Data Science curriculum, the Career curriculum, followed the great advice given by my Springboard Career Coach and my Springboard Mentor.  I did everything Springboard told me to do to become a successfull, skilled Data Scientist with a great professional network and high visibility. The results of all of that is I was hired as a Data Scientist on week 13 of the program in a certified ""Great Place To Work!"" international company,  which leads its industry in the US.

Pros:
- 100% online curriculum with great resources and lectures from Harvard, Stanford...etc...  All interactions with advisors, mentors, coaches are online and on a flexible schedule.
- You'll get enrolled in DataCamp and have access to extra practice/project work to master your skills (Python, SQL, Pyspark, Github...). I love DataCamp and will remain a member.
- You'll have access to LinkedIn learning, Medium, Towards Data Science.
- Weekly presentations (career sessions, business hour Q&A, guest presentation)
- Weekly meetings with your assigned mentor. You can schedule additional sessions if needed.
- You can select your own career coach from a long list of Springboard career coaches (their background and skills are diverse which makes the coaching experience invaluable). I personally chose one career coach and followed up with him throughout the program.
- You'll get to work on a lot of projects (40ish), 3 capstone projects to apply what you've learned and your work will be reviewed by TAs who have a great sense of humor.
- Springboard conference (Rise!) and seminars (wellness, career...) during which you can interact with fellow students, alumni, employers...
- Because the program is online and always accessible you can do it in 6 months as planned or in 4 to 5 months. I am now on week 16 with 84% completed. It is really up to you.

Cons: There are no cons as far as I am concerned however you need to know that the program requires drive and self-discipline because there is a lot to do and so little time... You'll get help and tips from your student advisor, the career services, your career coach, your mentor, the TAs, and even from other students. The bottom line is that you need to stay on task and have the time to work on your projects.

The program is worth more than you pay for. There is a steep learning curve but it remains fun all the way and it works! If you are afraid of not 'being good enough', start with the Data Science Career Preparation which will give you a taste of the level of statistics and Python coding you need. It is only 4 week-long, about $500 which will be credited towards your Data Science Career Track tuition upon successfull completion.",11/23/2020,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

There are things to consider as well: I was doing it full-time and it took me 8 months to finish.

The 1:1 mentor calls were priceless, with the assigned mentor as well as the additional mentor calls. The IDP (Industry Design Project) wasn't the best match (I was asked about my preferences but it all depends on the available projects, and people assumed that I'd be ok with doing something related to my old career, which wasn't the case at all), but with the help of my mentor I managed to turn it into a good portfolio piece. 
The career services were excellent, throughout the course and also after it was finished (6 months of career services are included after the end of the curriculum).

I also appreciated having a dedicated mentor, with whom I checked in every week. Springboard also offers unlimited extra calls with one of their vast corps of mentors.
Interspersed with the curriculum are career/job-focused units, which help you prepare your resumé and LinkedIn,  and gives you guidance in networking, informational interviewing, job interviewing and more, each with one-on-one meetings with a dedicated career coach.
I was truly impressed with the support of Springboard, and felt the entire staff, mentors, career coaches, were all dedicated to the student's success.

I don&#39;t feel like the ratings are true to what the career track really is. There appears to be very little intellectual property owned by Springboard. It is a set of curriculum that you could get straight off the internet without going through them. Sometimes the course is disjoint. Take for example convolutional neural networks. They had some high level Microsoft employee lecture on it. I went online and found a Stanford class on CNN that really explained it in detail and was free. That Stanford class provided insight to what CNN really is. I learned more from that class than what Springboard offered. Plus companies are looking for experienced data scientists. In my opinion they are selling a BA position. They ask you to rate the class right after you finish it and offer you a gift card. But now that I have taken other classes in other disciplines I realize their course is lacking. They don&#39;t have instructors that can put together a curriculum that is coherent and makes the instructor available for questions. As far as job support, I was not in the few areas where they guarantee a job. You would also think they would nurture relationships with companies, but I did not see that either. Did I get something out of it...yes. The Datacamp tutorials were good. I could have taken them on my own though.

The mentorship added value that if not there I am not sure I would have been very satisfied or would have been willing to pay even half the price of tuition. This is really where the true benefit of the course is. The curated material - yes over 90% of the material is curated form external sources such as Medium, YouTube and LinkedIn Learning. Is good but sometimes it was not structured well in terms of the order in which it was presented. Time estimates for some exercises were also way off mark for me personally but I would assume this can vary person to person. The one big con was my independent project or externship as they refer to it. While I was placed with a company that was a good match for me, they were based in India which made it very difficult to coordinate and work with them. It would have been better to be placed with a company in Canada (where I live), or at least in North America. In general they could work with having more connections in local countries that student&#39;s are in and this should be considered when matching people. A career coach in San Francisco cannot benefit someone in Toronto as much as someone in the country and even better the city can.

-Project based curriculum. I now have three case studies that I included in my brand new portfolio, all with the help of Springboard
-The industry design project is truly awesome. You get to work with a real company which is invaluable. Mine offered to have me continue working part-time after I finished the 4-week project, which it seems is pretty common from what I've heard. Some students I have seen get offered full time positions at their industry design project
-I worked full time alongside the course and so I was able to get a 2 month extension for free (so I did the course for 8 months total), I also got a couple of weeks off to catch up after a vacation (at no charge)

Cons
-It was a lot of work to do the course while working full time. It's possible, but it was definitely demanding. The course end date can be extended but you will have to pay extra, so since I didn't want to pay extra, I worked a lot to try to finish before the end of my 8 months, which I ended up doing.
-I was lucky enough to be able to pay upfront in order to save some money in the long run, but this course is definitely expensive. However, I think it is worth it
-I didn't like how a lot of the career coaches booked calls so far out in advance due to limited availability. I think Springboard recently hired more career coaches so that may be fixed, but while I was in the course availability was limited",9/22/2020,UX Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard
268683,2020.0,False,High support + Self-paced learning = Great bootcamp experience,"Pros: Great communication and support from staff (especially during COVID times); straightforward curriculum; weekly mentor calls for support and guidance; internship with a real company; supportive network of fellow students; ability to pay after you land a job; takes student feedback for how to improve the course; and career coaching continues after you finish the course.

Cons: Internship was difficult in terms of communication (my company was in India) and being able to do great work in 4 weeks; could be cost prohibitive for some (however, see above); doing the course alongside working full time could prevent you from finishing in 6 months;  I felt they could expand more on some things like the design sprint (since this seems to be the industry norm these days) and the mock interviews.

Overall, I had a great experience with Springboard and feel that they were truly supportive of me and met me where I was, with no previous design or tech experience (I came from a human services background).

I had an awesome mentor and many awesome co-mentors who helped with problem solving. The course demands a steep learning curve at times, so start with SQL and Python as you begin the course (or even earlier).

268583,2020.0,False,A good educational program; can easily become great,"Context: During my last year as a Ph.D. student, as I planned to pursue a career in data science, I decided to join the Data Science Career Track of the Springboard program. I was recommended by one of my Ph.D. student friends, who eventually successfully landed a good working position. I therefore decided to follow his footsteps.
Overall: I am quite satisfied with Springboard's program. I think it has formed me well to become a data scientist and to quickly land a job. However, I believe there are a few things they can still improve on.

Pros:
- Overall Quality: the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world, used in the industry. It covers most aspects of data science (wrangling, visualization, ML, ... ) and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field. Of course, it won't replace extensive years of professional experience, but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career.
- Preparedness: I would argue that the data science track doesn't require advanced programming skills, but it is best to have some Python experience (the software overwhelmingly used in the course). If you don't (like me), the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve. You eventually pass that stage though.
- The Capstone Projects: the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish. A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt, which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor. These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers. 
- Mentorship: Speaking of which, the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course (and why the price is a bit high). For those who need someone to look over their shoulder, it's definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course. The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard, bad experience with mentors is quite rare. Plus you can always change, if it gets really bad.
- Career: The career services they offer are equally useful. By helping you build your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, etc... Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers. The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations.
- Flexibility: While it is not something obvious when you start, you can actually ask for pauses, freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum, or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional / personal life (I assume they don't openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time). I personally extensively used those (mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph.D. work, specially when it came down to my thesis defense). I eventually completed the program in 12 months. However, I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame.  6-8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week. If you trail like I did, Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions.

Cons:
- Rates: their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it's mostly because of the number of resources they offer (mentors, career advisors, extensive curriculum, access to external resources like DataCamp). It's good to have that many resources, but in my opinion, some parts of the curriculum (maybe less than 10%) are useless or redundant. Therefore, I think the rates (assuming you avoid enrolling in paid extensions) could be 10% cheaper than what they currently are.
- Customer Service: this definitely has been the worst part of the whole program. I assume it's because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students (across all tracks) but their personnel's size  hasn't keep up with the trend. While I always eventually obtained the information I requested, it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person. First of, they only allow email communications. Then, their services are split between advisors, support team, finance team, etc... So if you ask for something to someone, they will most likely re-direct you to someone else. And the response time can be a few days. I don't expect every customer rep. to know everything and I assume it takes a while to train, but it is quite frustrating when you can't get a straight answer immediately, specially for finance-related questions or for deadlines (when you need an answer fast).",9/17/2020,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],4.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

Springboard is an opportunity, but you have to work hard to get the most out of it.

268397,2020.0,True,Overall Great Experience - UX Career Track,"<p>I really enjoyed my time being enrolled with Springboard. Strong points: - One-on-one time with your mentor (this is the strongest point of the course imo. My mentor was wonderful about getting back to me outside of the time he was required to by Springboard. I could not have learned what I did in this course without his help) - Additional mentor calls if necessary (these aren&#39;t with your mentor, but with a different mentor assigned by Springboard. I still found them helpful) - The structure of the course helps you really understand the basics and have a good foundation for the fundamentals of UX design - The Industry Design Project! Huge strong point. This will give you real-world experience which you can put on your resume and highlight on your portfolio - If you take the job guarantee, you&#39;re required to pass mock interviews at the end of the course: whiteboarding, portfolio walkthrough, and a behavioral interview. You get two chances to pass, but I passed them all on my first try and so did the other students I spoke with. As long as you prepare and practice you should be able to pass, but this is a strong point because it prepares you for the real-world interview process. I was really nervous for these but I&#39;m very glad they&#39;re embedded into the structure of the course - I have just applied to complete with Springboard, so I haven&#39;t begun my job search yet, but if you take the job guarantee you will also have access to career coaches 6 months post-graduation, which will be incredibly valuable - My student advisor (Molly) was incredible - quick response from her when I reached out, and she went above and beyond to address my concerns and make sure I was taken care of Sticking points (for me personally): - The course ran a lot longer than I expected it to. The projected time to complete is within 6 months if you spend 20-25 hours a week on the course. It took me about 11 months to complete, and I think this is more due to the course structure than anything else. Projects build on other projects, so sometimes I had to revise certain projects before moving onto the next stage. For the lengthier projects, I had to revise multiple times and it took a few weeks to get the go ahead from my mentor to continue. Like I said, he was incredibly helpful to me outside of the normal hours we met and I don&#39;t blame him for this at all - I think it made me a much better designer and helped me to go into the material in more depth. My sticking point here is just wishing that Springboard projected closer to a year rather than 6 months (for part-time students like me), but this could be something that&#39;s unique to my experience - I understand why the career coaching sections are built into the structure of the course, but I have to admit I really did just want to focus on the hard skills of the course and found it a little jarring that there were career coaching sections in the beginning/middle of the course rather than just the end. The reason for this is networking and building up your LinkedIn profile/connections during the course, so the reasoning is good. I just struggled with feeling like I really wanted to focus on the skills themselves before doing the networking Overall, I had a really positive experience with Springboard and found that they were really helpful and responsive when I needed them to be. I haven&#39;t started my job search, but if I&#39;m able to update this review later, I will when I have a better understanding of how that will look.

Most of the assignments were clear and could be completed with the provided instruction or a quick internet search. Only once or twice did I need to use the unlimited mentor call feature to get unstuck on something. I think the biggest value for me on this was the career support side. There are some modules interspersed with the technical material on how to search and how to manage you LinkedIn page. They help you with your resume as well.

268372,2020.0,True,Practical Skills to Help You Excel Anywhere,"<p>The UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Springboard is online learning at its best. Springboard pairs you with a personal mentor, career coaches, and a student advisor. You also have access to a large online community of fellow students where you can bounce ideas off each other and network. The program gives you practical skills to handle complex UI/UX challenges confidently in both B2C and B2B companies. You learn by doing and end up with a fantastic portfolio to help you land that first job. There&#39;s also an internship with a real company to put your new skills to the test while discussing any challenges you face with your mentor. Springboard is on the cutting edge of what&#39;s new in the industry. Coming out of the gate, I exchanged knowledge with industry veterans and applied what I learned in my present job. The learning material is high-quality. I got as much knowledge from this online program as I did from a traditional master&#39;s degree program at Northeastern University&mdash; at a fraction of the cost! There are flexible payment options for those who need them, and the staff is simply amazing. Your student advisor is there to answer all your questions and ensure you succeed. For example, my father got very sick early in the program and passed away. Then came the Coronavirus. Things got busier in my full-time job, which I didn&#39;t want to lose. Springboard understood that and encouraged me to take some time off while allowing me access to the course material. They have been incredibly flexible during the pandemic, giving students more time to complete the program, which is quite rigorous. I can&#39;t say enough about this program. I&#39;ve learned so much. There are many niche avenues to pursue within UI/UX Design, and Springboard covers all of them. Why should you consider UX/UI Design as a career? It is a gratifying career as you get to dive into users&#39; minds and empathize with them to deliver something that makes people&#39;s lives better.

In retrospect I would have taken the UI/UX Design Career Track but it wasn't available when I started the UX Career track. Regardless, I think this course was worth it. I got to collaborate with other designers for my IDP and the opportunity to collaborate made the experience much more amazing.

In the beginning I was unsure but I chose to stick through with it and it was rewarding when I completed the program. I also wasn't used to online coursework or engaging in the slack community because I'm not very active on social media so that was a challenge. But in retrospect, I think the slack community is something I should have taken more advantage of because more online engagement with others has made me more comfortable and confident when communicating and networking with others and the more insights I gain from their experience that I can use to inform what I want for myself. 

I also had a mentor that kept me on my toes and challenged me to perform and deliver better. And that resulted in a capstone project that I was very satisfied with the end result even though there's always room for growth.

There are small projects sprinkled throughout to help build your understanding and comfort with the content. Some of the resources are a bit irrelevant in their applicability to real world problem solving, and are not easily translated to a professional setting.

I knew 2 people who had gone through Springboard's UX Design Career track and they had good experiences. Because of COVID, all courses were enrolling online anyways, so that made my decision a bit easier.

Overall, I thought that the Springboard experience was outstanding: quality curriculum; supportive and highly responsive network of mentors, coaches and advisors; ability to move at your own pace (for me: fast). I loved that the curriculum not only covered practical UX skills, but also included career-building units to help you network and improve your resume, so you're ready to apply to jobs right after you complete the course. I had a wonderful mentor who shared his real-world UX expertise during our weekly meetings, and if I ever had a question or issue, the student advisor for my cohort was always available to help. I also loved my career coach calls--valuable time with actual recruiters in the industry who help you navigate the job search from updating your LinkedIn to salary negotiation. 

After I completed the portfolio unit, I immediately got traction in my job search. I presented projects from my Springboard coursework during the interviews, and felt comfortable talking about UX principles with my interviewers, based on what I had learned in the course. I ultimately accepted a senior-level role before the course ended, which was my ""above and beyond"" goal going into the program. 

I would definitely recommend Springboard to anyone interested in pivoting to a career in UX (Design, Writing, Research, etc). If you're a self-led learner and extremely driven to get into UX, you'll get a ton of value out of the program and will feel prepared to pivot your career like I did.",8/24/2020,UX Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
267786,2020.0,True,Big Oof,"I have been enrolled at Springboard since April of 2020. I took their Software Engineering Career Track Prep course in order to get a strong basis for the main course. This course had a lot of good coverage on introductory subjects like standard CSS, Javascript, and HTML. I have taken a number of college courses on these subjects beforehand and didn't struggle with the prep material at all. I also really enjoyed the teacher: Colt Steele. You can Google his name and get a nice summary of his accomplishments with Rithm School (in-person Bootcamp in San Francisco). My issues with the program started around Section 12-13. While the earlier sections are easy enough to understand, that almost everyone won't struggle with them, once you get into more complex topics....the issues with Springboard become more glaring. Colt does a great job at breaking down subjects in the videos and keeps things interesting with fun jokes and a lighthearted approach to learning Web Development. 

The real issues seem to be with the supporting material and structure that Springboard itself provides. You meet with a ""mentor"" once a week for 30 minutes where you can't really accomplish all that much besides discuss a few issues you are currently having with your code. I actually like my mentor a lot, but they aren't supposed to be there to support you constantly as you work through the various projects\assignments. Instead, you are asked to reach out to the TA's, which Springboard states are available via chat and email throughout the day. This is a lie. There are really only 1-2 actual TA's that respond via email and on my experience the chat option is really only available around 5% of the time. So after you type up the issue you are experiencing, you just wait for a response, whether you needed a quick 5 word reply on something, or an extremely complex explanation with multiple paragraphs, it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours to get a response. There are no 1 on 1 virtual sessions where a TA would join a Zoom call and work with you individually to track down issues. Instead you upload code to Google Drive and wait for them to download and par-ruse your uploaded code. 

Also the sections are setup in a really weird fashion. You are expected to watch 10+ videos all at once per section (each ranging from 5-20 minutes), and then work through exercises at the end, which could cover something you learned in the second video over 2 hours previously. Instead of re-enforcing important subjects along the way (and no, coding along with Colt does not count as exercises Springboard :) ). It ends up being extremely hard for individuals to have a feeling of cohesiveness between the instructional videos and actual assignments. It comes across as lazy and unconventional for a school you are spending $8,000-$12,000 to attend. My wife attended Flatiron and I recommend that bootcamp far above Springboard (as far as web development is concerned, I know they are solid on the data science front from what I have read). 

Pros:
-Colt Steele is a really good teacher, but can move a bit fast for some I imagine. 
-Material is presented with very modern tools, frameworks, and methodologies. 
-Fully online so you can ""do it from anywhere"" 
-Online Slack community of other students, though it isn't very active. 

Cons: 
-Extreme lack of assistance when working on larger projects\assessments. Just wait till you get to the Hack and Snooze app...oof. 
-TA's are basically non-existent. 
-Office hours are usually clogged with 20-30 students that are all working on completely different parts of the curriculum and getting questions in for your specific needs is near impossible. 
-Coding along with Colt during lessons is not good enough for reinforcement of complex topics. 
-Career Prep is essentially updating LinkedIn, Attending virtual events, and updating your resume. 
-No Pair Programming :( 
-Springboard just telling you to ""check the solution"" for answers. Giving me the answers, and helping me understand concepts are not the same thing. 
-Doesn't require enough GIT push\pulls to make your profile look more active to employers. 
-Basically completely self driven, which I know works for others, but not for me as I really enjoy structure. 
-Changed their ""job guarantee"" mid curriculum 
-Very little feedback from the maintainers of the curriculum as to why they are choosing to do certain things over others. 

If you are searching for an fully online Software Development, I sincerely recommend looking elsewhere (Flatiron is the only other school I can speak on personally as my wife attended). I have worked in a separate section of Information Technology for nearly a decade and I struggled a lot to use their learning materials. And for perspective, I have 4 year IT degree, and 10+ IT Certifications in infrastructure. 

TLDR:
Steer clear of Springboard unless it is for their Data Science Career Track.

266888,2020.0,False,More than just a beginner,"Listen, guys. Design jobs don't grow on trees. It's a very competitive market, I'll be the first to be straight with you about it. It's a bit like being both a businessman and an artist. We are here, mainly, to solve problems. They come in all varieties such as socio-economic issues, app functionality,  matters of convenience and satisfaction, and visual aesthetics. It's hard to be good at them all. The UX career track at Springboard will give you your fair share of experience in each until you come to understand what it is about UX that you are best at. For me, it's research and strategy. I can hold my own all the way through the design process, but I find the most joy thinking about the why's, and bringing insights into design. I like to solve problems on a systemic level.

As for the course, it's a highly sufficient curriculum that has enabled me to feel confident as I continue to learn design. The program has well vetted UX mentors that are industry veterans and are quite successful. And, the team of career coaches I've interacted with has been top quality. These people are true professionals and THEIR job is to get YOU a job. That's a promise.

But, it's still all on you. Make no mistake. A career transition isn't for the feint of heart, especially design. The good thing is that we are makers, so you should never stop making something. Never stop learning, and be courageous. And, be prepared to work for free or below your 'paygrade' (at first).

I am currently working on various passion projects that I will add to my portfolio in addition to the three projects I completed through the Springboard curriculum. Be mindful, you who are reading this, that UX isn't something you stop learning. I know there is a lot of information out there, though, and it can be overwhelming. Springboard was a great pathway for me to understand UX in principle and in process. But, don't stop with what they give you or it won't be enough. With that foundation of knowledge and experience, I've been able to further investigate principles I enjoy, and find methods that fit my needs and specific style. Springboard teaches design thinking, but there are other umbrellas of UX understanding such as CX and User-centered design, which Springboard introduces briefly.

Being a problem solver, I revolve around the core of UX, which is finding pain points. I've also incorporated a problem solving framework called customer jobs aka jobs to be done. I'm also investigating systems thinking and system's diagramming to use in tandem. These are just examples of many different UX frameworks you can add to your metaphorical toolbelt. Just find what you gravitate to. It's equally important to spend time designing and working with others. Other designers are your allies, but don't get too caught up in trying to be everyone's friend. Building meaningful relationships means being professional first. Add value to get value. Be genuine and authentic, seriously. Just be you.

Being you is very important because design interviews are really hard. You have to be tenacious the same as any jobsearch, but you are going to basically be auditioning many times during interview rounds. Jobs will want to see how you design and how you will work with their team. So, prepare well for the mock interviews, which are effectively the finals for the UX course, or you won't get the job guarantee that comes with the course, and you may not even get a job even after all that. But, without risk there is no reward. And, so long as you put 100% into your projects, you will be a confident enough designer to showcase your work in an interview.

I found a home in design because of Springboard. I truly believe that. My first love is writing, and always will be. But, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a problem solver by trade. I used Springboard to get an idea I had off the ground, and I'm so glad I did. It's the right place for me.

I had done a few Lynda/LinkedIn courses as well as joined the Interactive Design Foundation and felt like this course would be a piece of cake. It wasn't. 
The course plan was excellent: it covered a LOT - far more than in any of the courses I had taken until that point. My mentor was rigorous, too. I have been a designer for 20+ years and have a fantastic work ethic. But he pushed back on me and challenged my decisions (all in a good way). 
There were only 2 negatives: you will NOT complete this course in 6 months. Even if you were a full time student, there will be interviews and other logistics that you will have to set up where you are at the mercy of external factors. And, most important, because this is a *currated* course that draws mostly from other's work, it can at times lack consistency.

It is extensive and can take a long time to complete but the course is designed in a way that people without technical backgrounds and strong coding skills should not feel lost. If like me you do have a coding background, while the initial portions of the course may seem easy, there is a great variety of resources that are great for review. The team at Springboard is also supportive and flexible allowing you to proceed at your own pace offering breaks and extensions when applicable. The career support is also an important aspect of the course and the career coaches take time to help you optimize your job search and narrow down what you really want. It is expensive but I believe the resources provided give you all the opportunity to get your money's worth. Finally I would like to add that while there are flexible methods of payment, some allowing you to pay a majority of the course fees after completing the course and getting a job, a lot of these options were exclusive to American citizens when I applied.

They failed to get a job because this place fails at preparing you for any technical role, so they come back to teach... Till you pay money they keep on call you. Once paid they do not attend your calls and they disappear. Do not join with them. They are only good in marketing, once you opt for the course you will find amateur mentors who will give you PDF book. And worst part mentor or tutor leaves the session in between and postpones and cancels, classes never starts and they get delayed by months. Join only if you want to lose your money and not to learn or earn. Poor experience with staff. Many of them are not helpful and cater towards keeping their numbers high.

The material they teach is cutting edge with means of the programming machine learning tools, but not the most useful for industry if you are looking for an actual job in data and analytics.

It was a case of &quot;too little, too late.&quot; The &quot;mentorship&quot; was sold as a defining feature, but, frankly, I found it to be lacking. 3) Since leaving the program, I have found that there is a significant bias against it in my local area.

In the past years, I have tried learning Data science a couple of times from online learning platforms but had failed to do so mostly because after a certain point a push was needed to go that extra mile but it never happened.

Course Content

The course content is curated and consists of a wide variety of topics (right from Programming fundamentals and Statistics to start with) in a proper flow which enables synchronous learning. The content is sourced from a wide range of partners like DataCamp, LinkedIn Learning and Youtube and given these sources themselves update their content on a regular basis, you always get the latest and most updated material. For a field like Data Science, updated curriculum becomes a must-have.

Assignments and Mini Projects

You have plenty of them to continuously supplement your learning of concepts with hands-on. For someone who has a non-technical background previously, this becomes essential so as to not feel overwhelmed with lots of coding and no hand-holding initially.

Mentorship

You get matched with an industry mentor who has nearly similar years of experience in the industry. Not only does this foster a match in terms of mindset but also ensures a very open conversation flow between the two. Additionally, your mentor will direct you to a lot of additional online materials to supplement your learning

Eg:- My mentor has 6+ years of experience (same as mine)

Office Hours

While the weekly office hours are on a wide range of topic and not necessarily related to your progress on the course (not sure if that is even possible given a rolling cohort model of admission), they are a great insight into how Data Science is applied in the industry and the speakers give a lot of leads in terms of additional materials related to the topic of discussion. A brief note down of such leads act as great supplementary material when you are actually learning the topic

General Tips to benefit from any online MOOC/Bootcamp

Data Science, as a pathway, requires continuous learning beyond standard classroom methodology and the more materials you refer to while building your foundational concepts, the better your understanding will be.

Springboard’s course gives you that direction and streamlines your learning path along with a mentor who will help you navigate in this journey.

PS:- This is not a paid/biased review since I chose Springboard after going through several online bootcamp offerings (GreyAtom, Lambda School, RMOTR etc. For any further details on this, plese feel free to DM me. While I might not be a data science expert yet, however I am happy to guide you in terms of how to leverage this career track and stay motivated all the way through.

And regarding the worthyness of the course, having invested my heard-earned money into this, it’s highly recommended with the caveat that be prepred to grill yourself and as long as you keep up your motivation high, you will definitely see the benefit of this learning journey as you proceed along.",6/17/2020,Data Science Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

265507,2020.0,False,Solid starting point for your new career,"I would recommend Springboard to anyone looking for career transition/advancement who wants to keep an open schedule. If I had the choice again, I would absolutely choose Springboard over an in-person program. Having the whole course online meant I set my own pace of study and supplemented when I felt necessary. The course material itself is great, with a fair mix of hands-on exercises and video lectures. The curriculum is littered with mini-projects for students to practice their new skills further. The best part of the program for me was probably the mentor experience. The weekly meetings are opportunities to not just review your capstone projects, but to learn how to think like a professional. If you ever feel like you need more time to discuss something (and those half hour sessions can feel short), most mentors are available for messaging or possibly even extra sessions. One thing I really liked about the program was the heavy focus on building essential non-technical skills, like networking or storytelling. Thanks to the course material and the career coaches, by graduation, I really felt like I was ready to enter the job market.

Here are some changes to the curriculum I would recommend:
- Make mini-project reviews more important. While I talked to my mentor about some of them, I never saw a single review in writing. I think this would be a great opportunity to discuss theory and practice code reviews.
- Course material needs to be expanded in some key areas. 
      -Deployment was limited to one Github mini-project and a very high-level overview video. Graduating students should probably have some familiarity with Docker or other software for productionization.
      - Distributed computing was covered in just two sets of exercises. I'd prefer if there were not just more material on the subject, but some more discussion of the underlying theory.
      - While this may have been a result of me taking the ""generalist"" track, I felt the material on deep learning was way too light. We were given only one optional exercise that worked with Keras, despite it being the easiest major DL framework to learn and the least likely to be implemented at scale. Even some more optional reading material would have been nice.

The curriculum is well-curated - most of it is just resources and articles from the internet, however the way they walk you through each topic and assign projects applicable to each section really helps reinforce the content and ensure that you take away the necessary skills. On top of that, the one-on-one mentor sessions are a huge advantage and really help when working through more complex topics or projects. My mentor was an industry veteran working for an A list tech company and his insight into my growth as a designer and design process was absolutely priceless. To top it all off, Springboard offers a ""job-guarantee"", although it does require a pretty rigorous job search regiment (which I was planning to do anyway).

265318,2019.0,False,Mixed experience,"<p>After completing the program and securing a job, I wanted to come back and review Springboard again after experiencing their job search program. In terms of curriculum, I overall enjoyed Springboard&rsquo;s curriculum and learned a lot. The Harvard lectures are very informative and good for understanding machine learning theory. I do feel that their SQL curriculum is not very strong and could be improved, my SQL skills were poor when I finished the bootcamp. I also feel like there should be more information about basic Python coding - I had coding interviews that I was not prepared for. The two capstone projects are definitely the strongest aspect of Springboard and the aspect that got me the furthest in the interview process. Having projects to talk about really helped me in my initial interviews. My mentor who helped me with my projects was really nice and helpful! One thing that is a little sketchy that you should be aware of before you join: as part of the job guarantee, you are required to pass several mock interviews, and you only get two chances to pass each one. This did not impact me, but it is not something that is disclosed before you start the bootcamp. I was pretty satisfied with Springboard&rsquo;s curriculum, but what I was completely unprepared for was the competitiveness of the job market. It&rsquo;s tough to get interviews with no experience, and when you do get interviews, you have to be perfect or they will just find someone more qualified than you. I struggled with technical interviews, particularly coding interviews and business interviews (business is not my background). The mentors that they have to help you prepare for technical interviews are not super helpful. The job guarantee makes it so that they have a reason to help you get a job, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t find them that helpful - my career coach was nice and was good emotional support but didn&rsquo;t help me get referrals and didn&rsquo;t help me with technical interviews. Part of the issue is that I feel like there&rsquo;s only so much they can do - the data science interview process is really like the Wild West, every company does the interview process differently and it&rsquo;s tough to prepare. It felt like every company was looking for something different and it was impossible to be prepared for everything because there is just so much to know. About four months into my job search process the pandemic hit, and Springboard made a couple of major improvements to the job search program. The most important improvement they made is they created a Placements team that spend their time specifically looking for referrals and &ldquo;ins&rdquo; at companies for you. This was extremely helpful for me, and though the job I accepted was one that I found on my own and got through networking on my own, I got a few good referrals from this team. The second major improvement that they made was getting new mentors to help you with technical interviews. I got a job soon after I started speaking with my mentor, but I felt like he was very good and better than the mentor I had worked with in the past. Overall, a mixed experience with Springboard. I appreciate that they have the job guarantee program because they do try to help you, but I wish there had been more help sooner and not just because of the pandemic.</p>",6/9/2020,,3.0,[],3.0,4.0,2.0,springboard

I would definitely recommend Springboard to anyone who is serious about their career change and plans not to look back. It's not easy and it has been difficult and fulfilling work. I fully committed my time to the course since January since I left my marketing job last year.

The course was all-inclusive and I have found that since I have finished with it, I keep going back to certain sections and brushing up on knowledge (all the material is available permanently after completion).

I didn't fall within the requirements of the job guarantee (as I am based in London) but I was still given the option of completing the Industry Design Project, which was one of the best parts of the course for me - I worked with a startup company in America and worked on the research and design of a gardening app. 

Advice for prospective students - Use the mentor calls to get as much advice and information as you can, you'd be mentored by UX designers who have been in the industry for a long time and have a LOT of knowledge gold.

Springboard gives you unlimited mentor calls: during the busiest time of the curriculum for me, I was choosing to meet with 3-4 different mentors a week, which was awesome I got to do that. I learned the most from these industry professionals. There was 1 internship offered by the curriculum, and that was an invaluable experience because working as a designer on a team is very different than working alone. There was a unit in the curriculum dedicated to creating my portfolio, and I also chose to take the 2-month extension to have continued access to my mentors to just build my portfolio. 

The mock interviews at the end of the bootcamp covered pretty much everything you would see at a UX interview: portfolio walkthrough, white-boarding, and behavioral. I appreciate the unlimited career coaching calls as well, including Linkedin and resume reviews. The bootcamp didn't give you real interview offers though- I heard a data science bootcamp did this but not sure if this is something UX bootcamps do where they have connections that get their students hired. I heard some students in this bootcamp got hired by their internship partner though. 

The curriculum was informative: it is a combination of online articles and some articles written by Springboard mentors. These articles give more detail into UX topics and are good for referring back to (you get lifetime access to the curriculum after graduating).

Lastly, everyone I met was really friendly. The Springboard support staff is great and timely in their responses! The student advisors are awesome. The mentors know so much and the career counselors are so knowledgable. There's also a slack channel for all the students.

Pros:
Support. Best support of any program I've enrolled in. Hands down. 

Mentorship. So helpful when you're stuck on something that's not easy to just Google. Also great to just get general direction, career advice, etc. You don't know what you don't know, but they do! Use them!

Projects. Some of the projects were fairly challenging , and I come from an applied math background. So I'd say don't be shy of some analysis, but they will definitely help you build the prerequisites necessary.  They're also a great way to go back and relearn concepts you forget.

Capstone. The capstone is reasonable challenging and is based on metrics that you'd be judged on in the industry.

Cons:

Structure. This is subjective, but for me alternating between engineering and career modules made it difficult to just focus on the engineering tasks. I ended up taking an extended non-traditional path through the course.

Dependencies. This is more a knock on DataCamp, but I think Springboard's reliance on some of their courses isn't good. Depending on if you like DataCamp's style.

263948,2020.0,False,An Intense Overview of the Data Science Field with Great Support,"This program was a bootcamp with much information in a short amount of time.  There are many avenues of support from your assigned mentor and on-call mentors, career coaches, advisors, project advisors, a community forum, and options to join study groups.  I highly recommend taking the opportunity to join a study group and create a slack channel, have weekly meetings, and support each other.  
I had done prepwork with two other online companies; Thinkful and Galvanize.  I looked into other online bootcamps by those two and also General Assembly.  Further I highly considered joining the in person Galvanize bootcamp in Denver, including visiting them for a tour.  
Why choose Springboard?  
To drive and hour into a city, Denver, 5 days a week for 13 weeks was a big stressor on top of the curriculum for Galvanize.  I looked into living there in the city, which is not my comfort zone and very expensive!   

Thinkful seemed to be extremely similar to Springboard, and General Assembly too.  All had requirements of living within an hour of particular major cities.  I ultimately landed on Springboard midsummer because they listed both Denver and Detroit as their major cities for required money back guarantees and opportunities.  Further, it offered a Data Science Prep course that would then take the tuition paid and put it toward your tuition for the main Data Science Program.   
I fee I am struggling to comprehend all I learned as I end my program this week.   At this moment in time, and as of a few months ago, I feel for me and my own learning experience and strengths, I would have thrived even moreso had I gone the route of physically attending the Galvanize in person.  I would advocate for them to consider opening a location in a place like Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Rather than only big cities.  
Let's see how long it takes now to land a job.  Springboard is very good with support after completion.  I will still have career coach meetings and accountability.  It is asked to make at least 7 networking connections each week, and apply for 4 jobs/week.

I found the capstones challenging and enjoyable and felt as though they really helped me to understand the course material.

263255,2020.0,False,"Wonderful experience, just got a little long at the end by user error.","Positives:

+	Mentorship
By far the biggest strength of Springboard, so big that others have copied it. My mentor was just the person I had craved for a long time in my educational career: smart, good people skills, and accountable. I learned as much from him as I did in my Master’s program. The 30 minutes a week were invaluable and gave me insights I would not have found on my own.

+	Curriculum
For the most part, the curriculum is very good. It’s a combination of online resources Springboard doesn’t create themselves, but if I had to learn data science all over again, I would rather learn from these resources than random Google searches. Save the Google searches for the projects, where most of the learning comes from anyway. The curriculum is also more up-to-date than an in-person program. The projects stretched me to my limits, and I came out a much better data scientist because of it. 

+	Course Support
There has been an increase in course support over my time at Springboard. There is an option to have an additional mentorship meeting with a different mentor just to work on non-Capstone projects. Springboard also hosts an annual conference at their headquarters that is worth attending if you are a student. My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it.

Negatives:

-	Job Support
Springboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job, but it’s close. You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards. I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance, but they seemed to have hired new staff. I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role, but it’s an intense six months.

-     Completion Time
I took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish. This was more a human error than a Springboard error, and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard, I could have easily finished in the allotted time. Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects.

-     Feedback
Outside of my mentor, I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework.
  
Overall: Great experience, would do again. The positives are fixable and far outweigh the negatives and I found it paid for itself in salary raises, even with the extensions.

It is not only Python, but a some UNIX, some Git, some SQL, some pyspark, sort of everything you need to operate as a data scientist. This is a double edged sword because you learned how to do something, applied it for the next segment but would go a weeks without having practiced it. I spent a lot of time referring back which was frustrating. The most frustrating aspect is for most of the mini-projects, the assignments would ask you to do either new concepts/code or use functions/methods/attributes that were not emphasized in the interactive lessons. I again spent a lot of time referring back, combing through my notes, only to discover, it was not covered or not sufficiently. Perhaps, this would not be an issue if you had some previous skill with Python or a lower level language. My previous language was R.

The one thing that can make or break your experience is your assigned mentor. (And by the way, I would have never persisted through the frustration without a mentor.) I spent the first 5-6 weeks with a mentor who was not a good fit. This set me back for the first half of the course. I ended up changing my data set for the first capstone project after I had been working on it for three months. Luckily, my second mentor was extremely helpful and an expert. When I changed data sets, things started to come together. I also started to use more of the resources that Springboard provides - the on-call mentor and the TAs.  I could not get much out of the community chat because even within my cohort there was a different pace.

The career track means data science as a career. The career mentors were focused on getting jobs for data scientist or data analyst titles.

There are a lot of good things to say about the program. The most beneficial aspect is that you meet with a mentor six times over the course of the program. This turned out to be essential for me, because he not only corrected my code, but he corrected my way of thinking, which improved my work exponentially. He also introduced me to other resources that would dramatically improve my coding abilities, and every week he pushed me to think a little harder and do a little better. 

It's worth noting that the curriculum is curated, and so you could theoretically complete the equivalent program by paying a small subscription fee on Next.tech's site. But what Springwood really gets right is the structure of the program and the quality of their mentors and community. Best of all, the prep program is free if you end up going into the full data science career track program (they reimburse you 10 days in). A couple small notes: Next.Tech didn't quite give me enough practice with the individual coding exercises, but that was just me -- I think if I approached it a little less mechanically, it might have been enough.

There are  also more than 10 mini projects which are challenging and they really prepare you for the real world problems. The springboard support team is really helpful and they go out of their way to make you life easy during the course. 

Things you should watch out for: The estimated time suggested by Springboard for each topic is kind of on the lower range so you need to keep that in mind to plan your studies. Also, a very important thing to consider is that this is a mentor based course where in you get a mentor assigned to you for the entire course time who guides you through your projects.

Most valuable parts: 
- 1-1 weekly mentor calls, monthly career coaching calls
- in depth case studies
- building your own unique portfolio projects
Not-so-great parts: 
-Starting the course in November 2019 (when it was still fresh) felt a little like we were also beta testing it
- if learning communities are important to you, the community being online can be a challenge to adapt to

1. The curriculum -> mostly online coursework, some online lectures, some interactive lessons, and several mini-projects in addition to two capstone projects.
2. Mentoring 1:1 -> weekly Skype calls to discuss progress, technical questions, and receive general guidance for strategies.
3. Career coaching -> calls, resume help, networking tips, and job hunting that will ensure you find a new position.

262876,2020.0,False,"Great support, solid materials, and amazing staff!","<p>I found the Data Analytics program at Springboard to be one of the best online bootcamps for two main reasons: the people and the coursework. The coursework had a great balance of helping you learn the key material for the field of data analytics, but integrated a great balance with career development that helped you not feel overwhelmed. The course had a tremendous balance of being challenging yet not insurmountable. The weekly mentor calls were helpful, I felt like my mentor truly cared about me and my progress, but did have weeks where they were too short in length. Springboard does provide you with unlimited on-call mentors, which is helpful when you&#39;re stuck or need some help. The other shining part of Springboard&#39;s structure are the people, which is a tad ironic (to quote Alanis?), but everyone was amazing. The Slack community of students is more connected than I thought or experienced in previous boot camps. My mentor, Laib, as I stated earlier, was engaged, encouraging, and flexible as illness occurred in my family. My student advisor, Sophie, was off the charts in her kindness and helpfulness. Her fingerprints are all over the program, and she is helpful and warm to all students. Her genuine kindness was with a strength to me throughout the course, and an understated - yet extremely important - presence at Springboard. Chris, one of the main content creators of the course, gave me personal encouragement on my progress and completion of big assignments. I am in my 30&#39;s, but that personal touch meant a lot. And I&#39;d be remiss not to life up my career coach - Faren, she was superb. She made time for me, even when her schedule was stacked, to help shape my resume or cover letter for specific positions. She, like Sophie, Chris, and Laib, went well above my expectations or what I think was compensated by Springboard. The fact that the material was solid, instructive, and helpful, coupled with the supreme touch of caring and support (despite being remote), makes this an easy recommendation to anyone pursuing a growth or change into data analytics.</p>",3/20/2020,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

I personally had a wonderful experience with the mentor I was paired up with. He was hands on, supportive, and challenged me throughout the curriculum, based on my goals and expectations I discussed with him in our initial call. I appreciated how thorough Springboard was when it came to preparing students for what they might expect during a portfolio walkthrough or a mock interview. After speaking with others in other bootcamp programs, I was surprised to hear that some don't offer that level of thoroughness. 
Springboard is always open to feedback, and aiming to improve their curriculum based on student feedback.

On average it takes 6 months to finish but some students finish faster as little as 3 months or it could take more than 9 months, depending on your choice. You can either choose to pay upfront and get discount, or pay as you go monthly. Best thing about springboard is that you get unlimited Skype conversation with mentors who have years of experience in the industry!

The course is self-paced and flexible, so you can do the coursework on your own time. You have weekly calls with an assigned mentor (who is an expert in their industry) and they help you stay accountable for your progress. Also you'll have calls with a career coach that helps you network and find a job, which you can schedule as many times as you like.

Pros:
- Good support system. Curriculum has a good set of professionals that are able to communicate terms very well. 
- Mock interview are a good idea and do give you insight of what to expect. They also booster your confidence with the overall process.
- Capstone projects can be challenging if you decide to put the extra work and do help improve you portfolio to showcase it to potential employees.

Cons:
- Some courses need a revamp, for example the statistics part of it. While I was working through it, this specific course got updated and I really like the new version. I see that they are putting work on it, but I also think that some other aspects need to get updated sooner than later.
- No course regarding big data or cloud computing. The 2nd project we have to use Deep Learning components where we might have to handle 100K+ rows of data. For a normal computer, training a model can take a couple of hours (in my case 37 hours). Leaning how to use AWS or Azure is a requirement now a days.
- Better guidelines for at least the first Capstone project. It is very intimidating to start typing in a blank notebook. Getting a guideline to have an overall idea on how to start will help the student.",2/26/2020,Data Science Career Track,3.7,[],3.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

261700,2020.0,False,Great for self-motivated learners,"Pros: Free access to Sketch or Adobe XD for a year. Financing through Climb Credit helped me only pay around $25/month while I was in the curriculum (if you're a disabled military veteran, it is possible to have this program qualify for Voc Rehab, and get tuition reimbursement). Access to mentors, career coaches, and student advisors is really helpful in building your professional network, which you'll learn is a helpful way to make your name known as you transition careers. The Springboard community in San Francisco really tries to coordinate in-person meetups which helps foster the community of UX Designers, Data Scientists, and Machine Learning Engineers up in the Bay Area so you can meet your Slack channel peers face-to-face. There's at least one major event or conference that Springboard students are invited to join for free too!

Cons: You need to be highly motivated to finish the curriculum in the recommended six months (they offer an extension if you need more time). Some people may not prefer the curation of materials because it may not match how other people have learned on the job, and there isn't a dedicated instructor you can default to for questions. You'll just have your assigned mentor and access to a random mentor call to ask for help.

I joined the springboard course in the month of Aug,2019 and I left/discontinued the course in the month of Jan,2020

It’s not worth at all, simply i can say waste of your hard earned money and waste of time as well.

So called mentors will be not available as per the schedules and they don’t spend much time with the students in explaining their doubts or explaining the concept.

Next coming to so called office hours , coding support sessions it’s just for the name sake they fix up the sessions without even asking/discussing our availability time, i can they do as per their need.

They force you to enroll for the course by paying 1.9 Lakhs and they also provide you easy EMI/Loan by third party finance company, after your enrollment they don’t even care/bother about you concerns related to course .

Most imp thing is, they state you like 100%per job guarantee after the successful completion of your course in 6 months but the hard fact is you can’t complete the course within the stipulated time as they mentioned since you don’t get proper support from mentors/support team after your enrollment in any manner and course is not easy at all as they state you while enrolling.

Whenever you try to reach support team/student adviser to discuss your concerns they don’t pick your call many times and if they receive the call they just say will come back to you in few min/EOD or will solve within EOD but you don’t get any solutions on time or they try to convince you as per their needs.

whenever you try to raise your concerns regarding the course, you will get only one statement/answer like you are not attending sessions properly, not following the mentor instructions or you are not spending your time. They will never ever agree their mistakes and listen you concerns as well.

Most pathetic part - When you say i am not satisfied with the course or if you ask for the cancellation and your money back, they simply say we don’t have refund policy at all and they will again try to convince you to the fullest with the flashy words/statements. It’s like mental harassment .

My suggestions please don’t waste your hard money and time as well.

if you are interested to learn data science and to make career transition , we have many institute in Bangalore who offer data science course, ML , AI course with very minimum fee ranges like 15–45k with excellent course structure so please don’t get fool y enrolling Springboard.

All the videos/materials provided by springboard are available for free in YouTube .

When the entire course material is free resources why they are charging 1.95 Lakhs I don’t understand

Mentor ship(mentor call) is something they make as a star of the program. But you will get to interact with your mentor once in a week only for half an hour.

I never got a chance to discuss in detail with my mentor as there was a time constraints (mentor is be not available after 30min )

• The program is advertised to be 350+ hours. I spent over 900 hours and 7 months, so plan your time wisely. Most people I know also put in this much time, not just me.

Yes, you technically have ""unlimited"" mentor calls, but those are with a different mentor who is not up to speed on your project, and they are also limited to 30 minutes. Hour-long calls would have been sufficient.

Pros: This course leads you through creating a capstone project of your choosing, which is great because I've heard of other bootcamps giving every student the same projects (doesn't make for very interesting portfolios). They even match students up with a real company to gain some industry experience working in UX. I experienced some delays with my industry project, so Springboard extended my program for free and helped me communicate with the company to keep me on track. They are really great about giving students support and resolving issues quickly. 

Besides the great curriculum that helped me go from not fully understanding what UX is to feeling confident I can do well in a UX position, Springboard provided me with an outstanding mentor who will continue to be a helpful resource for me. They also continue to provide career support after you complete the program, so you're not just left to figure it out on your own. 

Cons: I'm not really sure yet. They offer a 6 month job guarantee, but to qualify you have to follow their instructions to make sure you're giving the job search all you've got. I haven't landed any interviews just yet, but hopefully soon.

1. More emphasis on deploying systems and system design. The curriculum delves very little into cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), preferring a more open-source based model. I think this is good in general, but machine learning engineers are inevitably going to be using one of these services in their careers. The course gives you credits for AWS, but little attention is paid in the curriculum to its use cases. Given all the time spent in the course, reading other paid material like ""Grokking the System Design Interview"" shouldn't be necessary if the curriculum is better formed. 
2. Techniques other than machine learning. It's kind of ironic to ask a course like this to do something other than ML, but knowing when ML is useful and when other techniques are appropriate (from heuristics to Deep RL) does not really get much attention.
3. More work on data collection. It would be much more helpful if the course explained more further up the pipeline on how to collect, ETL, and store data to make ML possible.

258275,2019.0,True,"(PhD in philosophy) Overall, Good Experience So Far","A little background: I'm currently about 25% through Springboard's Data Science Career Track program. My professional background is in higher education. I recently completed a PhD in philosophy and have experience teaching undergraduate philosophy courses. I have minimal background in math beyond the high school level, but my philosophy degrees have prepared me for the sort of technical and critical thinking skills used in data science. I'm doing the Springboard program to make a career change. I completed most of Springboard's Data Science Prep Course, which I found helpful, before being accepted into the Career Track program.
Review: Overall, my experience in the Career Track program has been pretty good so far. My impression is that the quality of one's experience with the program depends largely on the quality of one's mentor. My mentor was initially pretty poor, and I had a difficult time understanding his accent. But I reached out to Springboard early in the program, and they helped reassign me to a new mentor. Thankfully, my new mentor is excellent and has dramatically improved my experience. I'm in a study group with other students, and I've gotten the impression that their mentors are so-so. I have learned a lot so far in the program, and I've been especially happy with Springboard's ""customer support"" (very friendly and helpful) and career support (they get you started on job stuff early on in the program). A fair portion of the data science curriculum (so far) has consisted of Datacamp exercises. Springboard partners with Datacamp, and students get free access to Datacamp courses. Honestly, I haven't been that impressed with the Datacamp courses. They are helpful for gaining superficial exposure to tools and skills used in data science, but they don't cultivate a deep understanding. I will say that the time estimates Springboard gives (completion in 6 months, working 15-20 hrs a week) are pretty unrealistic. Most of my study group (including me) is working on the course full time, and we are all on track to finish in 5 months (at the earliest), and probably more like 6 months. Unless you already have significant data science experience, don't expect to finish the program in under 5 months, and possibly even under 6 months.
Overall, given my experience so far, I would probably recommend (pretty highly) Springboard's program to people (depending on their circumstances). I'm happy to discuss my experience with people if anyone would like to know more, especially people with an academic background in the humanities. You can find me on LinkedIn and around the web if you look (e.g. philpeople.org). Feel free to reach out.",10/30/2019,Data Science Career Track,4.0,[],4.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

If you&#39;re a part time student with a full time job, you most likely will be looking at more than 6 months depending on your pace. You&#39;ll also be paired with a mentor and it&#39;s a coin toss on whether or not you&#39;ll get a good one. With that being said, the program is flexible and the Springboard staff is dedicated to helping you work through your schedule. If you end up with a mentor who isn&#39;t helpful, make the effort to communicate issues and give it a fair chance. If the issues continue, talk to your student advisor and he/she will pair you up with a different mentor. I&#39;ve personally experienced this and was later paired with an incredible mentor. My student advisor was also incredibly compassionate, kind, and helpful during my Springboard journey.

You always knew you had help if you got stuck. Lastly, I really enjoyed the community aspect of the course. It provided a forum for Q/A, and often my question had already been asked by another student, so I was able to get an answer immediately. This was great for those moments when you're stuck on an assignment and don't want to wait for your mentor's email or call.

 Advice for those considering the course:

1. Keep a steady pace. Plan out in advance how much you will work on the course each day.

254918,2019.0,True,Springboard Business Analytics course.,"At first, I was a little nervous taking this course due to my limited background in this particular field, but I felt that it was a necessary component to add to my profile to help further my career. 
Following the introduction meeting, before the course started, the student advisors took time to answer any questions those starting the course had and did let us all know that this course was designed for those with limited experience in this field, which soothed my nerves. They also let us know that they (the student advisors) were there for any questions or concerns we may have had throughout the duration of the course, which was also very calming. 
When the course started, your mentor set up weekly Skype chats and you have your first introductory call with them, where you discuss your previous background, what it is you hope to gain from completing the course and ultimately, get to know them.
When starting the course, you are presented with a library of knowledge for Excel with readthroughs and instructional videos ranging from basics to more advanced functions which becomes very helpful as the course moves on. It was also great that you can revisit these lessons, any time you get stuck.
As you move forward into the case studies, you are given all the information needed. Extra material is provided that will help you specifically for the case you are working on complete with mock scenarios. What is required of you in each case study, is laid out in a way that is easy to follow and removes any guessing on your part.
Although I was told to make sure your mentor is right for you and you feel comfortable working with them, mine was very helpful and knowledgable. **Do make sure you feel this way, if not, speak to your student advisor** They are there to help and guide you, not give you the answers and your weekly calls are key to being successful. They will review your progress and give you revisions to make if needed.
Each case study I completed, focused on a different scenario (Forecasting, Root Cause Analysis, and Customer Segmentation) and really help me see the data I work with on a daily basis in a new light and made me think to myself, ""I could be doing better at this"" and as I was moving along in the course, I felt that my work had changed also, so I was taking what I learned and applying it immediately.

For example, I was able to partner with a local Family Law Practice that was just getting off the ground and use their business as my main project to build demand generation and other Digital Marketing tactics around using real dollars.  It was awesome to see how the curriculum, and great support from an industry specific mentor melded well together to allow me to build and execute a Digital Marketing Plan for the law firm.

254130,2019.0,True,A good intro for those new to the field,"I elected to enroll in the Springboard Data Science Career Track after leaving my previous field (science education). In order to get into the career track, you must have some background in coding, so I actually completed the Intro to Data Science course prior to the career track.  Enrolling in these in succession allowed me to learn python and R at a level where I am comfortable using them for work. 

When I first entered the program, I had no background in coding or statistics. The intro course helped me with the statistics but if you are new to stats or haven't studied them in a long time, I recommend you go read ""Naked Statistics"" first and practice the stats on Khan academy- trust me, this will save you time in the long run. The career track was decent although there are definitely sections that could be more robust. Base python is skimmed over a bit- students are introduced but more practice would be helpful. Spark could be a class on its own, so this is just meant to be an introduction to Spark and TensorFlow. 

Overall, I would say that the career track (and the preceding intro course) are worth it if you are looking to make a career transition into data science. The career advisers are incredibly helpful and the mentors that are assigned to you within the course are amazing at what they do (you will meet weekly, even on holidays).

Despite being familiar with the basics of these and other concepts (I have a Master's Degree in a program that covered these areas) I was very surprised at how much I didn't know and how much I learned through Springboard.

The course work is challenging and have applied it to my current work on various projects. However, the most valuable aspect of my experience with this program was the mentorship I received as I completed the course. My mentor was someone who provide some of the most valuable advise and guidance with respect to business analytics. Being a business analyst himself it was great to hear about this field from someone who has been working with these concepts at such an advanced level.

REVIEW

I thoroughly researched all of the other options before entering into this track, this one's the best.  Other bootcamps charge $10,000+ for coursework that teaches the same principles over the same length of time.  Additionally, springboard comes with a straight-forward job guarantee.  

The quality of the course material is repellent.  I’m an avid learner and have taken many online courses through community colleges and state colleges.  The amount of knowledge you gain and support you get from springboard makes universities look slow, petty, wasteful, unresourceful, and greedy.  Much of the course material is drawn from online sources, but this is now common practice in higher academia.  The coursework is highly informative and of sound quality (rivaling and surpassing the quality of a HCI course I took at PSU for example).  

What’s more, at the end of the career track you will also have a portfolio and a website platform to showcase all your work - critiqued by senior designer to make sure it looks right. And a CV and cover letter that is evaluated by those same designers.  You also get a weekly one-on-one mentor throughout the length of the course.  My mentor, Ciarda, tailored every session to my needs, was efficient beyond compare, and was always accessible.  You can also schedule help from additional mentors whenever you need.  

Finally, the administration of springboard is flexible, personable, and does right by its students.  I had the intention to complete the 6-month track within 3-months (I was on the month-to-month payment option so this would make the course $2,000 less for me).  There were a few set-backs that pushed me a couple days past this deadline.  The career track manager, Dave, very kindly worked with me through the obstacles to make sure everything worked out fairly. 

Going into it, I was worried a bootcamp might just be another form of degree-mill.  The company isn’t about extorting students for money, but really wants to empower students to and earn a good name doing so.  Way to go!  I’ll likely be coming back for the AI/Machine Learning track once I get my Python up to speed. :)",8/8/2019,UX Career Track,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
253101,2019.0,True,"Springboard UX Career Track provided me the information, guidance, and space for me to learn and demonstrate my expertise in UX","Prior to committing to Springboard's UX Career Track, I spoke to several different representatives and mentors from different programs to help me pick the most suitable one for me. While Springboard doesn't necessarily always have their own content for the curriculum, the articles, videos, and project briefs were very well-curated and the mentors I came into contact with were all very professional and helpful. 

I am not sure that this program is for everyone but that has nothing to do with Springboard: If you're not a self-driven perfectionist, doing an online course at this intensity could become very overwhelming. However, I do think the mentor program helps give students the extra kick they might need to stay on track. Thanks to my mentor, who later took on the role of a 'colleague' and a 'friend' in addition to a 'mentor', I had a great time discussing and debating my research and design decisions with her. I also loved the professional research presentation and portfolio walkthrough—I was matched with some amazing UX professionals who gave me invaluable feedback and assured me of my talent and abilities. 

The only con I can really think of is that the course is essentially designed in a linear fashion and students often do not look through future units when they're working on something already. However, with the industry project and several presentations and mock interviews in the latter part of the course, time allocation and planning can become tricky if students want to finish the course in a certain time frame (for me, it was 4 months) and didn't plan ahead enough. It would be wonderful if there was a more user-friendly check list that provided students with more information on what's coming up next (e.g. deliverables and interviews expected in the next two units).

253235,2018.0,True,Data Science Track,"The main positives to take from the course are the interactions with the mentor and the interview preps. Now I had a very hesitant mindset about applying for a bootcamp wondering whether I would be able to get employment considering I do not have a computer science degree or a STEM degree. I have a political science degree. I was told that these things do not matter and that you can easily land a job after you get both your projects done. I had done very detailed projects and posted them on github and did everything the career coaches suggested I do. Unfortunately not a single data science position had reached out to me. 

Now for the curriculum. This was sadly most dissappointing. The course mainly revolves around data camp courses. And then these are supplemented by youtube lectures from Harvard or other institutions that would talk about the subject with the impression that you have intermediate knowledge of the subject matter, despite it being a beginners intro video to a concept. I have had much better success with the self study resources available on the internet, such as youtube tutorials etc. Also did two Udemy courses for 11 dollars each and got a better understanding of the subjects.

Was asked by my employer to transition from graphic designer to UX designer, which was quite a jolt for a person who is later in his career. Despite reading books and taking Lynda.com classes, I really didn't have an idea of what all was involved in UX design; as I learned with Springboard, it goes much deeper than creating user interface art for webpages. Springboard helps to walk one through the entire process from beginning to end--which is actually not the end--since by its nature the entire design process is constantly improving itself for the end user. You are provided with an experienced, working-in-the-field, accessible mentor, who helps walk you through the process, provides support and valuable feedback as you go. Another plus is the curriculum isn't presented from just one viewpoint, it's given from a variety of industry experts, presenting the student with multiple perspectives and providing great resources to follow after the class is completed. Overall I would recommend Springboard to anyone who is interested in the field. It has been a great way for me to become more knowledgeable and immersed in the field.

There was so much information to get through in a small amount of time, but I was at least exposed to enough information and resources that I feel very confident in my ability to continue learning on my own or go to a higher level class/job. I had no experience with python before this course and I feel very comfortable with various libraries, statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms. The course itself does not have the capacity to teach you statistics or go in depth with how the machine learning works as much as I would have liked, but for the scope of this course, it was great. I can do all of the day-to-day routines as an early-career data scientist. This is a good place to start once you have a little background first. I was putting in about twice as many hours as it was saying the average student puts it, because I was behind on my understanding and knowledge base.

252553,2019.0,True,Money well spent!,"I recently transitioned to digital marketing after a 10 year stint in the oil and gas industry (Story for another day!). After thorough research, I got my first job after 3 months of enrolling at Springboard's Digital Marketing Careers boot-camp . Prior to that time, I'd bought several MOOCs on Digital Marketing , which lacked a structured curriculum. Truth is, there is so much stuff out there on DM, you can easily get overwhelmed. 

Springboard offered an intense and structured curriculum covering all topics from traditional marketing to more advanced content on digital strategies and tools. Speaking of tools, they grant you access to paid tools which you'll use  throughout the entire course. You will develop REAL content (landing pages, blog content etc.)and launch REAL campaigns (PPC and Social). You'll run REAL A/B tests for web optimization. The SEO curriculum played a HUGE role in securing my current job. The course also comes with a one-on-one mentorship involving weekly Skype sessions with a subject matter expert in Digital Marketing who tracks your progress. A major attraction for me was their Google non-profit partnership which enables you work with a REAL non-profit to manage a $10,000 Google ad grant! These and several other projects you'll work on will form your portfolio at the end of the program.

The online community was also very interactive. Catherine Leipold was such an agel! Awesome student relations and always quick to respond to queries. Calvin Nisbet was my career coach, another great guy who gave me tips which proved quite useful in my job search.

Will I recommend Springboard?? Hell yeah! 

Lastly, I'll add that the success of a bootcamp is a function of your commitment. The course is self-paced, and would require lots of discipline to meet up with weekly deliverables.

I noticed that curriculum is mostly made up of content that you could find on the web. I found that iffy at the start but then I appreciated how it was presented and how it helps you better digest what’s being taught.

The Springboard team is really amazing! Their responses were quick, professional, and reassuring. How they handled issues with the projects and people involved was done very well.

250691,2018.0,True,A successful experience,"Towards the end of 2018, I was looking for a UX bootcamp to make the career pivot. After digging around, I decided to join Springboard's (SB) UX Career Track because with the job guarantee in place and affordable tuition, I felt reassured that it would be the quickest and efficient means to get into a new industry. 

Now that I'm done, I believe this was one of the wisest decisions I've made. What I liked the most about SB is that it is designed to be very resource-conscious, and even though they are an online program, you actually get a lot of one-to-one/real-life interaction. They are genuinely invested in your learning and success, and everyone I've engaged with through the SB network—from the administrative staff to mentors to fellow coursemates—are really smart and supportive individuals. You don't get the impression that they are just ""running a business"" or scheming to milk your every dime. The entire experience was very human.

The curriculum is also very thoughtfully designed. Even though at first I thought the idea of ""curated content"" rather than ""original content"" may be a downside, I have come to appreciate it. Because we are reading materials written by multiple people on similar subject matters, I have a better feel of the overall disciplinary discussions out there, and I feel like the knowledge is something I could confidently fall back on.

Even though this is an online/remote program, I am glad to see that over time SB is investing in more in-person activities and interactions, such as onsite community events. One of the three projects we had to complete was an industry design project (IDP) where we get paired with a start-up to do real client work. My student advisor, Dave Weiner (Hi Dave...), thoughtfully paired me up with a company that works with education, since I came from academia myself. The office of the start-up was also located really close to where I live, so I actually got to visit the office and meet the team in real life. Because of this human thoughtfulness, the whole internship experience unfolded much more smoothly and successfully, and in the end, I got hired back as full-time staff without having to go through endless rounds of resume (re)writing, etc.

The fact that the industry project turned into a real full-time position really helped me get the foot in the door (which is the hardest step really), so I don't take it lightly. But even without that luck, I do believe that in the current product job market, having real work experience is more important than learning of any shape and form, so having the IDP as one of the units was a huge advantage. Hopefully, SB will continue to invest in the IDP/internship program and expand their professional network, so that more students can continue to benefit.",7/12/2019,UX Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Anyone can take free courses online to learn how to code in python, but having everything arranged in a structured environment with a completion deadline really helped motivate me to do the work.

Those weekly chats allowed me to reorient and refocus the project when I thought I hit a wall.

My (2nd) mentor is very patient, knowledgable and supportive. Always thinking from my perspective, and sharing all he knows about a problem. 

SpringBoard is also very supportive when I had to switch mentor two months into my program. I think it is worth the effort to find someone that is suitable for your background and situation. Don't settle down with someone you don't feel comfortable.

SpringBoard administation and student advisor team are also very responsive everytime I need help. 

One thing that may require improvement is the course material, which appears to be a big collection of online videos and articles. So after going through, I would not treat it as a structured course like from school, but rather a big libary with most things about data science up to now. The good thing is that I provides me a complete picture of what are the things available and need to know.

Towards the end they offer a short training in deep learning and language processing based on your choice. 
What I like most about the program is the career development technique.

Career coaches take their time to understand your skills and traits to provide customized counseling that works best for you. From the first day of the program, you are advised to craft your ideal resume which will make you stand out in the competitive job market. Some of the activities that ensure your success in job search are the LinkedIn networking, attending Meetups, reaching out to the managers and employees of the prospective companies, and informational interviews to get referral.

There is a community of people looking to help you including career coaches, weekly mentor calls, which I used to discuss the projects I was working on as well as specific questions about coding. And an online forum of students asking questions pertaining to the same types of projects you are working on. The main focus of the course is completing two main capstone projects which are geared towards building your portfolio and are exemplary of work one may do in a data science career. While there are many smaller mini projects included in the course that are also good practice to improving python and sql skills, there could be created content designed for learning the code and applications needed in these types of assignments. A significant portion of the curriculum was just courses on DataCamp and video lectures, while informative, are not particularly useful in grasping the concepts needed. For an expensive course, I was expecting more specialized resources focused on learning the skills needed, rather than just projects that force you to know the material and go out and use it, which is difficult at first and slowed my progress throughout the beginning of the course. I viewed this as being both a good and bad thing, because although I began working on these projects without all the necessary knowledge and skills, it forced me to pick them up as I went along.",5/20/2019,Data Science Career Track,4.3,[],4.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

Only half an hour a week with your mentor , but you still get unlimited mentor calls with other mentors that are available.
Limited slots for Portfolio Review (Probably will be fixed with future students)

- dedicated mentor

- Excellent administrative team
- Excellent career support team with advice well in line with reality, always super friendly
- Show you how to network properly
- Annual springboard rise event
- Involved student community

Cons: 
- too much use of videos and not enough use of reading for many of the subjects. Many of the topics could have been better explained from a book or article than watching many of the webinars from Harvard or pycon in my opinion. Those videos were often very lengthy and hard to follow along with and I found myself skimming through them. They didnt have decent background information before the these videos that would delve into complex subjects sometimes. This is my biggest complaint to be honest. 
- Some of the assignments needed better instructions such as the databricks miniproject. I know trying to figure something out yourself is the best way to learn but when you dont have the 
preknowledge on something so new to you it could be frustrating

Summary:
Springboard was exactly what I needed as someone coming from a background in business and who had next to zero technical skills such as coding. I landed a role as a  contingent worker  at Facebook as a business data analyst. Without a masters degree or more extensive work experience in tech working with data, i still havent been well suited for a data scientist position, so I'm supplementing this with starting a masters degree program in data scientist, but I believe if you already have a masters in any field and or have remotely relevant experience working with data, a masters degree wont be needed to land a data scientist position like I think is needed for me.

The  1:1 mentor calls every week, was excellent support and pushed for me. The other advantages were about the four mock interviews that Springboard provide to get us ready for the real interviews.

At the same time, I was able to meet weekly with a mentor/industry expert and meet with a career counselor when necessary. I had heard negative feedback from friends who attended Hack Reactor or Galvanize about the career counselors. Because of this I did not expect much from my own career counselor at Springboard, however, I was pleasantly surprised because Calvin gave me great feedback and tips for improving. The ability to get input from experts and meet with real people made a huge difference. Springboard's UX Design Career Track is new and there were some things to improve on such as typos or content. However, the course continued to improve during my duration as a student as they received input. Springboard was also extremely responsive. Dave, who was in charge of operations, would always respond within 24 hours. I also had the opportunity to meet up with other students living in the Bay or connect with them over video chat for projects. Though the course itself was remote, this community aspect was great. Other than that, I really enjoyed the layout of the course and the mix of multimedia content, which made learning fun. Some articles, some videos, etc. I also think being able to click a button and mark each item off as complete is really satisfying for the student and sort of gamifies the experience.",5/9/2019,UX Career Track,4.3,[],5.0,4.0,4.0,springboard

Some of the chapters in the curriculum simply pointed to youtube videos, which often (though not always) excellent at explaining data science concepts. Some of the chapters linked to Datacamp courses, which are often a little too easy but do explain the concepts well.

The bootcamp offers a curriculum of mostly third-party resources (YouTube videos, academic videos and online coding exercises), some first-party content and of course the projects and mentor guidance for all of this. I found the curriculum to be comprehensive, though brief in the Machine Learning sections. This makes sense as this is not the full 6-month Career Track program. It gives you a foundation to further research and understand ML techniques, e.g. on Kaggle.

The curriculum has a nice balance of videos and reading material, and they are good about not throwing too much at you.  Having a mentor to meet with every week was the best part, by far.

250852,2017.0,True,Springboard's Value is in its Active and Growing Community,"The course materials weren't too difficult to grasp; some were a bit repetitive. 80% of the materials are free – with a few expections such as the Lynda/Linkedin Learning lessons. At the same time, the materials were properly divided among each core topic of UX design. The pace definitely starts off slow but picks up towards the end, with projects requiring more hours and recalling skills you learned in previous modules. It was a good pace for me, someone who didn’t have any professional design or coding background. The course doesn’t touch on any coding languages or skills – but focuses on the research, interpretation of data, and materializing the information into a prototype. Every week, I spoke to my mentor for 30 minutes to go over whatever topics I wanted; ranging from their own professional experience to my course progress. Other than a 1-on-1 mentor, there are also mentors in the community answering and providing feedback to your questions and projects; they listen and care.

Since this course is monthly-subscription based, there aren’t any strict deadlines. However, I suggest doing your best to complete the course over the average 2-3 months. Maybe 5 months at most. I had to take a long break (pause my access and monthly payment) due to fatigue from my full-time job. However, the break was too long and I had to revisit all of the old materials from the earlier modules.

I just completed the course 2 weeks ago and still looking for a job. But I knew it was going to be tough to get a job straight out of any of these ‘bootcamps’ especially since my portfolio consists of just 1 project at the moment.

The curriculum is very well designed with nicely curated material. It teaches you the most important skills that a person transitioning into DS would require, but at the same time gives you the flexibility to work on projects and pursue the learning journey with a bit of autonomy.
The mentoring was also a great experience, it was just the right amount of support that I needed - my mentor provided motivation to keep rolling and was very helpful when I was feeling stuck, and also provided insightful feedback.

While the course is self-paced, it is still incredibly challenging.  This course recommends 3-4 months to complete, but I definitely needed the full 4 months.  The mentors at Springboard are great--supportive, knowledgeable, and incredibly generous with their time.
The curriculum itself is tough--some of the programming lessons are in DataCamp, which I found very helpful; some of the stat lessons are in Khan Academy, which I also found helpful; some of the lessons are lectures in a series of YouTube videos, which I found a little bland and hard to refer back to later on in the course; and some of them are articles, which really varied.  The course material is definitely comprehensive, but there is no definitive textbook to refer to, so it's really hard to problem solve when you get stuck (I ended up just going outside the course and Googling for a lot of things).
Completing the course requires a lot of one-on-one mentor time, some of the curriculum, and a lot of determined, creative problem solving when the curriculum just doesn't cut it.

It covered all the fundamental techniques of data science, machine learning, and data management in Python and SQL, and made sure you understood them. The project-based assignment system really improved my skill in implementing the methods.

I've taken a lot of MOOCs and I'd say this was the best. The only con was the price. $500/mo is steep, but I got a scholarship that made it cheaper.

Also, keep in mind: this is an INTERMEDIATE data science bootcamp. You should go into it knowing some basic programming and stats, and you'll leave with a lot more knowledge and skill in data science. You won't be quite pro after this, but that's not what it's for. If you want to really expand your knowledge in a few months and understand the ""core curriculum"" of Python data science, this is for you.

I was first paired with a mentor that I didn't feel a strong connection with and ultimately was unsatisfied with our discussions, but the Springboard team was very responsive in providing a solution with providing feedback to my mentor to try to improve on our sessions, and then ultimately reassigning me a new mentor, who was wonderful. The course lessons are expansive and well organized. I would say the one thing I didn't like was how the progress bar felt inaccurate because the final capstone counts as 20% of the course, which is not well explained. But really this was a small issue, that didn't affect my overall course experience.",4/15/2019,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
247605,2018.0,True,Springboard is setting the pace for a new wave of learning online environment! UX Design Programme rocks!,"The question I always ask myself when providing a review is - could my words make a positive impact in someone's life? I consider concept of Springboard as a leader and pioneers of mentor led UX programs. More than the educational program itself, a genuine and experienced mentor can make all the difference in the world. @Midlife I needed to make the right decision, I did not feel like taking a gamble with time or money. 

After 4 months of deep research around the country and even outside of the USA, my resounding selection was the Springboard UX program. Although I did not have the best experience with the first mentor pairing, the immediate correction made all the difference in the world for me. I hit a home run with an incredible UX professional as a mentor (Andre) for my Springboard UX program. To make it even better was the amazing student support team that was always available to… yes! Great support it’s students. 

Pro’s: 
- Program Content is very complete. 
- Course work can be heavy at times, for good reasons as you immediately get to practice hands-on what’s important.
- Perks as a Springboard Student are excellent and add incredible value. 
- Mentor concept and support is probably one of the best features and differentiators this UX Design program. 
-  The program has certain custom flexibility if you are pressed on time or maybe due to other obligations. 
- Student support is very agile! They actually listen to students needs.
- Cost is not high nor low. It’s right in the middle. Monthly payments are manageable if you plan ahead and make good use of your time. 
- Student community is an asset, it can be slow at times as most students are in fact busy.

Con’s:
I found none!

What would I make better if I could? The student community could use a more engaging and more dynamic collaboration tool. Is good today, but It can be amazing with the quality of the Mentors/Program and student community the Springboard programs have.

If I would do it again? Absolutely yes!

The only downside with this program, was that the cost was misleading. I thought the course was $1500 for the 3 months.....but it took me like 8-9 months to finish, and i didnt know I was going to be charged $500 monthly until i finish the course. i think they need to do a better job of explaining that.

247538,2019.0,True,Great UX experience. Loved the course,"This was a great program. The course work was pretty easy to follow. There were only a few times that I got bound up and the mentor (everyone is matched with a mentor from the start) helped me work through it. The problem was so much Springboard as it was on my side because the process I'd used for over ten years was different than the one Springboard requested. But that's a selling point of the program, you are paired with a mentor that helps you through that stuff!

The content is solid and there're so many optional pieces that you can go through if you want to learn more about any particular part of the UX Design process.

The only ""negative"" for me personally was that the timeline to complete the program was longer than I had hoped. The 2-3 months that Springboard touts is pretty ambitious for some. I think that timeline is for someone who is doing this program full-time or has no other commitments (ft job, kids, etc.). I have kids and a full-time freelance job so the program took longer for me, but I will tell anyone who listens that it was absolutely worth it.",4/5/2019,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

The most rewarding part is the mentorship and make sure you are connected to a mentor which you like. The level of expertise of mentors vary in their network and you will have to be proactive in reaching out to student adviser if you don't like your mentor.  The curriculum is very organized and covers the majority of things you will need for a entry data scientist job.

Due to life circumstances, I had to freeze and extend my completion date during the latter half of 2018. When I returned, I made sure I kept the same mentor as that was an absolutely highlight of this experience. I was working full-time while enrolled.

Pro:
Mentor relationship

Con:
Depth of coursework

My mentor was simply superb, this was in my opinion the best feature from this program that differs itself from others. Having a professional data scientist with working experience to offer insight concurrently while the course progresses enhanced the learning experience, I was able to bounce questions and solicit feedback both from course content and my perfornce freely and openly on a weekly basis. This has helped fuel my growth tremendously.

Although, in my opinion, I wish there was stronger emphasis and more depth offered on the machine learning portion of the coursework. For those who are curious, the way Springboard structures their coursework follows the format of data science work flow: Familiarization with programming -> Data Wrangling -> Exploratory Data Analysis/Visualization -> Statistical Inferences -> Modeling/Machine Learning -> Delivery of Results/Implementation. This flow offers a very good broad perspectives on what a Data Scientist does, but I was left craving a bit more material on the depth of Machine Learning models, such as the math and science behind some of the methodologies and the tools used.

In terms of Job Assistance, I thought the career advisors I worked with provided good feedback. However, I thought a lot of the resume and cover letters support are readily available online already, and that the job opportunities within Springboard I noticed are more relevant for students in the SF Bay Area and NYC. For those not living in the two areas, the process will not be noticably easier.",4/3/2019,Data Science Career Track,3.3,[],4.0,3.0,3.0,springboard

The mentor-led model was really the bread and butter, as connecting with real industry professional added so much value to my experience with the course and UX Design in general.

The experience with their career coach is really great and helpful. I learned a lot of skills about how to approach the companies and cultivate myself to be a strong candidate in the job market. The courses provided by the program are not really the best for people who have not a lot of experience with data science area. Also, some of the courses are not really up to date and the materials of the courses are not easy to be found. Besides the courses from the program, I need to find other resources instead. As for the mentor, I think it is also a great sell from the program. It is great to have a 1:1 personal mentor. I learned a lot of industrial experience and how to become a data scientist what companies are looking for. Just a tiny complaint about the mentor experience is that a well-experienced industrial expert sometimes is hard to understand why an entry-level person would be stuck in a simple question (to them).

Why would you NOT choose Springboard?
- If you absolutely have to learn R. (You're going to be learning a TON of stuff. Unless you're already expert-level at Python, R would be a distraction for you right now anyway.)
- If you absolutely need to have an in-person experience (they may have an on-site, I don't remember).
- If you don't want a 6-month bootcamp (they probably have shorter ones, I don't know).

Why would you choose Springboard?
- You want to go at your pace, on your time. (It will be hard, because you're learning a lot, but you can do it.)
- You want to focus on only the things that will allow you to go confidently to an employer and say ""I will add value to your organization from day one, even as I continue to learn more, and here's my proof."" BAM with two projects that you designed and implemented yourself
- You want a reasonably-priced, right-sized course with good financing. It's basically all the stuff you need, leaving out all the stuff you don't.

246590,2018.0,True,UX Design: Great course for Graphic Designers!,"I took Springboard when I was still working as a full time web developer. I didn't have the opportunity to do any design work like was promised in this position, so I started to look at other options to pursue a career in design.

I went to school for Graphic Design before my web developer job and I was freelancing on the side, but it wasn't something I wanted to do full time because I saw how the trend in the work field was shifting from print to digital. I have a friend that is a UX Designer and after learning about what she did, I knew UX Design was a career I wanted to pursue. 

I chose Springboard because I was impressed with the curriculum and I liked that the max amount of time I'd have to spend weekly on doing assignments was 15 hours a week which I could handle with having a full time job. I also liked that all students get a mentor while they're doing the course, and Springboard was more affordable and shorter term than the other courses I looked at. It was also completely online which was ideal.

I already had experience doing month-long coding bootcamps in order to learn web development and a 6+ month course was not something I was interested in, as I was trying to transition to a new career as quickly as possible.

Springboard covered a lot of topics on the research side of UX which was what I was ultimately interested in because I already had experience with User Interface Design. My mentor, Cari had a plethora of knowledge about the UX design field since she's done it for about 10+ years. She provided helpful constructive criticism on my assignments and my projects would come out more pristine and better aligned with the industry standards after receiving her feedback.

Dave was an awesome student advisor and was always available to answer my course related questions. The course offered Office Hours in the evening which included interviews with UX Designers who had been in the field for a few years and would offer advice and share their experiences. I only went to a few of those but the ones I attended were helpful.

I started interviewing for my current job when I was in module 8 of the course. It was at the same company my friend worked at and she encouraged me to apply. Springboard seriously prepared me for the interview process even though I was no where near the career prep section of the course (that's module 14).

However, everything I learned up until section 8 helped me through the interview process, and Springboard's articles on Medium about preparing for interviews was also a life saver. The course in combination with the articles taught me how to explain my work and discuss the typical UX design process, since I had experience with that through the course.

I was interview around 4 times, with different members of the team/recruiters which included an in person interview and I also had to do a design challenge which I was very nervous about but I took everything I learned so far in Springboard and applied it to the challenge. 

I'm happy to share that I got the job and have working there for 3 months (since January), but I decided to still continue with Springboard and I completed the course the end of February 2019.

I would definitely recommend Springboard to those who already have a design background and are looking to gain more experience in the research aspect of UX Design. Even those who have a research background such as Psychologists, Communication/Marketing (I have a BA in Communication) majors will also find the course helpful if they're looking to transition into UX, however, the UI Design section isn't as thorough in this course like in the UX Career Track, as this course is only 3-4 months long.

If you're looking for a course that goes more in depth when it comes to UI design, the UX Design Career Track for Springboard might be a better option. That course is 6 months long with career coaching and a job guarantee, but the application process is much more extensive and the price is higher. You also have to have a previous design background to gain entry into that course so the UX Design course that I took might get your foot in the door.

Overall, I'm grateful for Springboard and all they have to offer. I highly recommend them!

They help you focus on what is important to learn so you spend less time on learning useless information. Your mentor is able to guide you when you do not understand certain concepts. And they make you concentrate on career development which is the part I hate doing, but it is the most important. Overall, I am glad that I have taken this course because I feel confident that I have developed a great foundation to start my data science career.

246875,2018.0,True,A great start,"Springboard's project-based, mentor-guided curriculum combined with their helpful and friendly career services and support staff made for a wonderful experience as a student. There is a broad range of skills learned and practiced through projects including statistics, hypothesis testing, data visualization, SQL, and applied machine learning. Through your capstones, you can dive deeper into data science topics that interest you. Since there is a job guarantee, a fair amount is asked of students, including finding additional resources to help complete projects. For me, this meant spending a minimum of 20-25 hours a week, so make sure you are able to carve out time in your day on a consistent basis.",2/14/2019,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard

You are given a free membership to DataCamp while you are enrolled in the course. There are also actual Harvard Computer Science lectures provided for some of the machine learning topics. Something I didn't know going in, but was a nice surprise. Then, there are mini projects and your major capstone project. The projects can be challenging at times, but that is what it takes to learn. There is also the mentor aspect, which is great. Weekly calls with an expert to keep you focused and provide assistance on projects or any other advice. The community is not as strong as they advertise, but I think this is expected as most people are very busy and aren't looking to go out of their way to help other students.

246644,2018.0,True,Entry level data science boot camp program with Skype tutoring,"This is an entry level boot camp program designed for students with limited background in data analytics.

Pros: Weekly mentor calls is the main selling point, I enjoyed chatting with my mentor, but you need to be well prepared with agenda items, otherwise 30 minutes can pass so fast with no solid progression made. The mini projects in Jupytor notebooks are all very interesting and insightful, I think I've learnt more from those than videos and quiz. While I can see the trace that those are probably not what they originated, they did make modifications to those projects so it ended to be a good summary of each section. 

Cons: I'm not a big fan for a student proposed capstone project. I can easily imagine someone getting stuck at thinking about valuable business ideas and reliable data source to begin with their project, especially for a program facing inexperienced students. The program course material is mainly from Datacamp, there is nothing wrong with that business collaboration, but you won't feel happy realizing Datacamp subscription is only $29 per month. I convinced myself I'm mainly paying for the tutoring, and this could be subjective people believe it worth the price or not. Not much job support if you are not choosing the career track.

One suggestion I'd like to make is to alter a little big the tempo of the program. Currently I can strong feel a jump of level of difficulty moving from statistical inference section to machine learning, and I consider myself half-experienced for those topics. If this is supposed to be a program for people start thinking about exploring their career at data analytics, I think you can simplify on machine learning topics and make the mini project as easy as what datacamp offered. If you believe this is a hard-core data science program, you'd like students to put more hours into the topic.",1/29/2019,Intermediate Data Science,4.0,[],4.0,5.0,3.0,springboard

If you're someone like me who needs a structure to their learning then this is a great course for the price. The Mentor meetings are really great, my mentor Andre provided great insight whilst taking an in-depth interest in my project, which made me feel like I was getting my money's worth.

The course content is also brilliant as a new starter in UX.

Something I really wanted to know was how long it would take:

If you're working part-time, you can complete it in 2-3 months.
If you're working full-time, you are looking at 3-4 months.
I was working full-time during the completion of this course and it took me 4 months. However, the insight I've gained is massive and I feel like I've learnt a lot about UX.",1/26/2019,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

What also makes the career program so great is the career coaching. I’ve not also learned new so much technical skills, but networking skills as well.

246474,2017.0,True,A very good learning experience,"I enrolled in the Data Science career track. I completed my course a couple of weeks back. I opted out of the career assistance because I already had a job which I am not planning to quit any time soon. I completed my course work. I had to interrupt my course twice. Once due to flooding and the other time when I was about to be a father. On both occasions Springboard paused my course and were supportive of me resuming it later.

Pros:-
1. Structure: The course is well structured and gives you a good idea of how to progress
2. Exercises: There were a lot of exercises which gave a very good insight about how a data science project progresses. This included basic and intermediate statistical analyses and advanced topics.
3. Projects: Two capstones make you practice a lot. The capstones along with mentor guidance solidified many concepts in my mind.
4. Mentors (Biggest Pro): Having a mentor was the biggest pro. I was matched up to an excellent mentor, an expert in the field and he was extremely patient with me and always pushed me in the right direction. I understand a mentor can be different for different people but if they match you up with a mentor who is helpful, extract every thing from the opportunity.

Cons:-
1. I felt that not enough attention was paid to big data and data engineering. Maybe they will fix it in the future.
2. The content was...ok. You can find equally good video materials on YouTube if not better materials.

You get to talk with him or her once a week and talk about the course material, your project, or any questions you might have. The hardest part for me was sticking to the schedule. It's nice that you can set your own pace but bad because you could potentially waste months and months not doing anything on it and no one will push you to get it done.

The only downsides were I had to really rely on my mentor for examples of professional projects (it would have been nice to have more in the curriculum) and 30 min calls weren’t always enough time for him to teach and answer questions.

The course gave me insights into machine learning and made me a savvy consumer of data visualization methods. There was great variety in the types of data and questions you could explore in your capstone project.  I used sentiment analysis in a natural language processing project conducted on Twitter data.

The Springboard administrative staff were friendly and professional, and the rules allow flexibility.  However, I found that the Springboard curriculum guidance underestimated the time for completion of project tasks and interface with Github.

246381,2018.0,True,A wealth of knowledge and a mentor to set you on the correct path,"before participating in the online UX course from Springboard i had a general idea of what user experience entailed, but had no idea the steps, processes and skills involved in creating a full fledged team of contributors. this program was initially appealing to me for a few reasons. 1) my current position has always been a hybrid design/front-end coding and i wanted to be able to create more effective designs backed by user data 2) my company had started to explore the UX space and toy with installing a process and team and 3) this course also comes with a mentor that can help you through the course materials and project.

the course materials are sourced from many different sites and while i thought this strange at first, i felt that it really added something extra to the course. first and foremost, it resulted in a large list of resources in the way of design and UX websites, blogs, organizations and tutorial sites that i now had in my back pocket and could continue to use for years to come (not to mention you still have access to all the course materials after completion). the other thing i found that i liked about this was that everything was not in the same voice, so you tend to get different perspectives on processes and techniques. that along with the fact that i felt the course dove deep enough into each discipline to get one’s feet wet made this a very valuable course IMO.

to top it all off, Springboard as a part of the UX course matches each student with an experienced UX professional. each week you meet (online) with this mentor and review all the knowledge you are soaking up and discuss to make sure you’re understanding how all the pieces fit together. my mentor had years of contract experience working for companies like PayPal, Apple and Cisco, so she had a wealth of first-hand experience and knowledge to share with me and helped me to understand the application of all that i was learning. this feature alone was worth the price of admission for me.

the one drawback i would take from this course could also be turned into a positive depending on your availability and drive. this course is a “work at your own pace” situation, so if you are overly busy (like i was) or just not motivated enough, the course can drag on and get expensive (you are charged monthly in some cases). that being said, another good part of having the mentor is that they help to keep you on track so if you are ready to make your way through the course, you should be fine!",1/8/2019,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,springboard

Mentors are available by email, and there is a community board for posting but I felt like that by the time I was meant to review I had forgotten what questions I had. Overall I think it was a bit too free forming and needed to be more concrete. On the plus side, my mentor was very smart and offered valuable input when it was asked. There were some great subjects that I felt really stuck and couldn't be forgotten. I really enjoyed how Springboard utilized DataCamp to teach R.

As a front-end developer, I have to improve on my UX knowledge to create better user flows for websites. But I didn’t know where to start, so I did a bunch of research and came across Springboard UX design course. Since their payment plans are based on monthly subscription and the price is pretty reasonable, I ask myself why not give it a try? 

I started the course with a Skype meeting with my assigned mentor and we talked about my goals and expectations of the course. Along the course, there are many mini UX assignments which I find it useful because I’m more of a hands on person when it comes to learning. 
I also have weekly meeting with my mentor to discuss and give valuable feedbacks on my assignments. My mentor is really patience with me and he explains in detail the reasoning behind each assignments and how to apply in real life cases. 

Aside from that, Springboard have a list of readings and I usually read them during my commute to and back from workplace so these tasks are easy to accomplish. Although, I find some of the course materials really time consuming such as long videos, but some of the materials are optional and also it is not mandatory to complete 100% of the course materials. (Although it will be good to)

Towards the end of the course, I get to create my very first UX portfolio to submit as my capstone project which I find it useful especially for starters who doesn’t have a portfolio.

The one aspect that took me by surprise was that the content is fully sourced from a variety of online resources. I guess I'd suspected that there would be some original content. Not that this was necessarily bad - the resources were mostly very good, and would have been very difficult for me to find on my own.

In my first week I was assigned a mentor and introduced to all of the software / learning platforms.

The first month was centered around learning python, SQL, and completing a slew of DataCamp courses (You get a DataCamp membership with your Springboard course) that really prepare you for your big projects, the Capstone Projects.

You work with your mentor to choose your projects (The first one is intended for a simple but deep data set, a good example is the Capital Bikeshare dataset from the UCI Repository, feel free to checkout my github for an example Username: JonOrr . Meanwhile the second project requires a bit more data cleaning, think along the lines of a kaggle competition.) then you follow up through weekly calls that keep you on point.

Throughout the course you'll also learn how to better conduct your job search, interviews, and role targeting (Do you want to be a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, etc.). There is a job guarantee that gave me a lot of confidence while I was doing the course, it has a good amount of terms and conditions, but all of them are reasonable. They include but aren't limited to: Apply to 5 jobs a week, don't skip any interviews, etc. The career team works hard to make sure you get into a role that both fits your skill level, and your career goals. Let's say you want to be a Data Engineer and are quite suited to it, they won't push you to be a Data Analyst instead.

One month after the completion of my course I was offered a Data Scientist position with a competitive salary (going to keep the number confidential but it was strong) in one of the regions of my choice (You choose 2-3 regions at the start of the course, I chose: Boston & San Francisco) I could not be happier with my experience.",12/28/2018,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,4.0,5.0,springboard
246238,2018.0,True,A decent online course experience,"The springboard UX Design online course is a cheap alternative to the in-person bootcamps. The course goes through the basics of UX design, allows students to complete 1 full project, and pairs students with mentors. Mentors are extremely knowledgeable and helpful and are well-connected in the industry. The project goes through the full UX design process, and gives you material to put onto your portfolio at the end of the course. The online forums, or community, is composed of fellow classmates who are available to give feedback and provide information or help.
The concept of UX design relies on obtaining feedback for any work you have created, and this is one area that Springboard struggles with. Students who have completed some work need to spend a lot of valuable time finding people to help them with things like surveys, interviews, user testing, card sorting. Additionally, some of the curriculum can be repetitive and overlapping.",12/28/2018,UX Design,4.0,[],4.0,,,springboard
246133,2017.0,True,Springboard,I would recommend this course to a friend! This course is very suitable for someone without industrial knowledge of data science.,12/19/2018,Data Science Career Track,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard
246319,2017.0,True,A positive learning experience in UX Design,"I attended the Springboard UX Design program from September 2017 to April 2018 and had a great experience. I initially started my course in 2016 for three months before pausing the program. Since that time the curriculum was significantly revamped for the better. The strongest aspect of the course are the mentors providing weekly coaching. I had three mentors throughout my Springboard courses, two of which had experience in the game development industry, which was important to me. One of my mentors did not have much experience in the industry and as a result I requested a change in mentors. This was the only negative experience I had with the course, and resulted in some duplicated work when I transitioned to my next mentor. Even though this mentor did not have game development experience, they had plenty of Fortune 500 UX knowledge and if my desired job was not so niche, I believe the mentor relationship would have been excellent. 

The curriculum has a relatively short beginner's guide to UX concepts before introducing the capstone project. The capstone will take up most of your time, and all of the small assignments build to this final project. I felt like the training content (largely through Lynda videos) was applicable and engaging. It helped to apply the ideas from the video directly to my project as I took notes. Having a capstone to constantly build on while studying these concepts provided constant motivation. My mentor also helped take concepts and apply them to my project. I found it easy to speed through sections I was already well versed in, and enjoyed being able to take my time in sections that were new to me. Something they don't mention in the on-boarding/ marketing material is that you also get a year's Lynda.com subscription with your Springboard course. This is a great resource to access if you have other disciplines you want to study.

Overall, I'd recommend this program with the caveat that if your mentor doesn't feel right for you in your gut don't feel afraid to contact Springboard support immediately and talk it out with them. They are very responsive and immediately placed me with a mentor that fit my needs. I'm glad I learned the skills I did, and was able to create a professional portfolio from my learning experiences.",12/19/2018,UX Design,4.3,[],4.0,5.0,4.0,springboard

246122,2018.0,True,Introduction to Data Science,"I completed the introduction to data science course in 3 months. The course used the R programming language and covered important skills required of data scientist. This included data wrangling, data visualizations, data story telling, probability and statistics, and machine learning. The course also provided career resources. The material in this course was good and I believe I learned a lot. There is also a capstone project you are required to complete. This is where you bring all the skills you learned together. 

The best part of the course was a mentor who’s is a professional data scientist where you get 1:1 calls once per week. You can chat about anything data science related. The mentor helps guide you and motivate you, especially on the capstone project.

All in all I thought the learning experience was really good.

-Support is great. Never went a few days without a response
-Mentor was very helpful
-A lot of practice on the analysis side, which was great, since I wanted to get into data analytics, but not so much practice on the Data Science side of things
-Mock interviews were helpful
-Mentor put my name in for a position and I was hired as a contractor, so it's already paying off

Cons
-Second half of the course seemed a little unfocused (though that might be because of the track I chose)
-This might be only with the career coach I was paired with a few times, but they seem to rely heavily on contacting random people to ""grow your network"" in order to eventually get a job. They don't do much on the side of directing you to anyone who can realistically get you a job.

I took their Introduction to Data Science course in fall of 2017 and their Data Science Career Track course in 2018.  The course was a great alternative to a fully immersive bootcamp, since I wanted something that allowed me to quickly learn the skills required for a Data Scientist while still being able to work my full time job. The course does require a lot of self-discipline in time management since you're working through everything online and there is a lot of material to get through. I ended up spending an average 10-20 hours per week working through the course material so that I could finish in 6 months. The biggest asset for me was the weekly meetings with my mentor. He was a huge help in making sure I understood the tutorials and assignments and he helped keep me accountable and on track.

246072,2018.0,True,Great introduction into the field of UX.,"I signed up for this course after learning about UX and wanting to make a career change.  Ultimately I chose this school over others because of the access to mentors and flexibility to complete the coursework on my own time.  I was completely new to the field so I wanted mentors to help guide me.  Also I worked full time, so I didn't want to commit to a specific class time every week.  The overall course structure starts with a product idea that you create and walks you through the UX design process with the guidance of a mentor.  The actual course work is pretty much a compilation of videos and articles that are available publicly online.  For a beginner, it's nice that the course organizes the content appropriately.  I wish the time with the mentor was longer, because 30 minutes once a week comes and goes really fast!  It's important that you're mentor clearly understands what you want to get out of the course, that helps to determine how detailed they are in feedback.  Hallie was also an amazing student leader and Fabio & Emily were great as an additional resource in the weekly office hours.  You can check out videos on YouTube to see how office hours are structured.

Compared to other bootcamps/online courses I've done they really make an effort through the mentoring and support to genuinely help you get to where you want to be. In my case, I was familiar enough with most UX concepts but hadn't had many opportunities to put them into practice or demonstrate my skills, and wanted to move into UX design as a career.

To that end, the curriculum was less important to me than the opportunity to work on an end-to-end design project with mentor guidance, which I could then use to start a portfolio. So the capstone project was a perfect format to help me reach the main goals I set out to achieve when choosing a course, namely to feel more confident in my UX and visual design abilities, and to have a portfolio to share with employers. However, the learning material itself does give a good grounding in a broad range of UX concepts and skills, so if you're a beginner you'll definitely be sent down the right paths. There's a tonne of UX information out there online, but on the whole Springboard do a good job of bringing the basics together without getting you lost in the details.

My student advisor, Dave, was kind enough to help me determine how to reach my personal goal and spend what I could afford.

Although there is no job guarantee (apparently, a ""UX Career Track"" course was recently added for this purpose), the UX Design course helped me learn new skills and flesh out my existing portfolio. A lot of UX job ads specify that a UI background and/or HTML and CSS skills are required, which are areas where I currently lack proficiency. I'm hoping I'll eventually be able to get a stable UX job (perhaps after acquiring more technical knowledge) or apply my skill set to a similar field.

231567,2017.0,True,Springboard Launched my Career,"Springboard's course on User Experience (UX) Design profoundly changed my career path. Only three years ago,  I was a philosophy major at Vassar College. While I was a tech-enthusiast, I always believed that my non-coding background limited my ability to enter this field once I graduated. However, by sheer luck, I stumbled upon Springboard's online UX course and signed up. At the time, I hardly had any little knowledge of what UX was at all. Now, as a UX Designer at IBM, I cannot stress how pivotal this course in enabling me to jumpstart my career.

Springboard uses an intuitive website to guide students through the various stages of designing a mobile application or website (which may conveniently enough be used as a portfolio piece). Utilizing a mixture of articles, interactive courses, and videos, I was able to gain a firm understanding of the different design research methodologies popular in the field. This was important on two fronts. Firstly,  these techniques helped me design better applications, since tools like card sorts, interviews, and wireframings genuinely help you design better experiences and can be applied virtually anywhere. Secondly, the techniques I learnt served as buzzwords to those I interviewed with for UX Design roles that demonstrated my knowledge in the field.

On top of this, there were two aspects that made this course truly successful. The first was the weekly Skype calls with a design mentor. At the start of the course, I was assigned a mentor who was a professional in the field. Once a week I could consult her with any questions about the coursework, or any career-related questions I had. Cultivating this relationship humanized the course for me, and transformed it from a collection of videos and literature to a full-fledged course.

Pro: - Mentor was great, had real-world experience and served as a great resource to help me define a good question and project as well as solve technical questions w/ my coding. She also provided extra resources if I wanted to practice or further develop a skill from the program. 
- included some optional extra projects and lessons for many skills, so you could easily do extra practice if desired. 
- Great lessons on ML and AI applications, and A+ lectures.
- Career services was very involved if desired, and very flexible about providing support. 
Con: - not enough lessons/ practices provided for advanced SQL , which ended up being emphasized in the career process.

I always wanted to take it to the next level by learning data science/machine learning, but I always found it too difficult to do on my own. There's just too much knowledge/learning-paths/etc. out there that I kept getting confused on which way to proceed.

Thankfully, I found Springboard. They have been an absolute lifesaver. The best thing about the course is that it lays out a clear path on how to get from A to Z. No more constant confusion. The mentors there really helped guide me and keep me focused on what really mattered and not get lost down a rabbit hole etc.

Attending the Springboard UX Design program helped me fill in some gaps about the UX Design process. I had some exposure and practice with the UX process before taking the course. However, my knowledge and experience were minimal. The Springboard UX course helped me gain some new skills as well as giving me a few mock projects for my design portfolio. 

Having access to a real mentor gave me the confidence that I was on the right path to learning UX design. My mentor was helpful and insightful in answering questions I had about the UX process and the new skills I was learning. In addition to the online training curriculum, I also had the support system of fellow students taking the course. This was helpful when getting feedback about my projects. 

The cons:
The Springboard UX Design course is a great course for anyone who is alright with learning online. If you like to ask lots of questions, or need to be able to interact with other humans then this course probably isn't the best. Although you do have access to other students through an email type system, that about it. You are assigned a mentor, but you have limited time with your mentor over skype or via phone calls.

The strongest part of the course is the access to the mentor(s) and the team of career coaches. 

The curated course content overall is very good, though some lectures are from 4-5 years ago.
The main focus is the two capstones and the mentor interaction to keep you moving forward on them.
The Python datacamp courses (at the time) where mostly useful, though at some points I used other materials from courses like Udemy or LinkedIn Learning where the curriculum fell short of the coursework being asked.
The coursework at many points has incorrect time-estimates for the (2-4 hrs suggested but actually needing 10-20). Some coursework questions and worksheets were out of date or missing. If you have a full-time job then staying on a schedule based on the course completion time then you will be as frustrated with this as we were. The most common observation on the forums was the poorly supported statistics element, with insufficient course material for a crucial element of data science and insufficient study material for the coursework.

245637,2018.0,True,Springboard Data Science Career Track,"I attended the Springboard Data Science Career Track program for ~5 months. I did some research before entering. I had some coding and data analysis experience before entering. This one suits me the best among other data science courses, because (1) It's online, so I don't have to quit my job. (2) It's mentor supported, very few if any online program offer that (3) It has a job guarantee. Overall, the experience was fantastic.

The curriculum, while not perfect, is well curated and organized and covers not just technical subjects, but also career support. I get 30 minutes with a mentor every week to review my assignments, answer my questions, etc. My mentor had similar background as I do and had gone through the academia to industry transition before, so he was able to offer valuable advices in addition to technical guidance. At the end of the course, I was required to pass 4 mock interviews and complete two capstone projects which prepared me a lot for the job hunting. I landed interviews from many companies, from start-up to large companies like Amazon, near the end of my study. Though, I have to say, the course alone won't be enough for interviews at the likes of Amazon and Google, it should be sufficient to help you land you positions at mid-tier companies.

Overall, I find what I learned very useful, the experience with my mentor pleasant, and the cost reasonable.

244905,2018.0,True,"Great, self-paced bootcamp with weekly calls","I started the Data Science Career Track bootcamp in April 2018, completed Aug 2018. 

BACKGROUND: Graduated with a master's in one of the biosciences, few months prior to bootcamp. Due to my work, already had background in data analysis, stats, and programming in another language besides Python. Some Python tutorials were sufficient for applying to this bootcamp. 

CURRICULUM:  Covers required basics, esp for data science interviews. Mostly based on pre-existing materials online, but Springboard does the legwork of sifting through the overwhelming sea of Internet resources and curating them into a chronological curriculum. Additionally, they’ve got their own resources, including lists of interview questions and networking how-to’s. These were immensely helpful. I also used the interview questions as a study guide, which paid off as several topics appeared in actual interviews. 

STAFF/MENTOR: Lots of support – you can schedule calls with a career coach, do mock interviews, and generally interact with other people in what could otherwise be an isolated journey of self-teaching. Incredibly professional and knowledgeable staff, very responsive customer support. 

I was also very happy with my mentor. The first one I was assigned to was a bit lackluster, but after having to postpone my start date, I ended up with another one. My weekly call with him helped me stay on track, and he was incredibly helpful and encouraging. This included post-bootcamp, when I sought his advice on choosing between jobs.

CAPSTONE PROJECTS: Critical part of my resume, since I didn’t have industry experience or data sci projects where I used machine learning. Starting a project can be intimidating and unfamiliar, so the bootcamp provided me structure. Another Springboard staff member grades your project and provides feedback - I wish their comments/suggestions were more detailed though. 

COST: Steeper than I’d liked, but it paid off. I had the freedom to pursue this full-time, so I did the per-monthly plan hoping I’d complete it within 2-3 months. I ended up taking 4 months, but still avoided the heftier 6-month charge.

JOB HUNT: Again, YMMV – like I suspect w/ many bootcamps out there. It’ll be up to you to do a lot of the networking. I reviewed my Springboard curriculum, plus lots of extra reading outside the curriculum (particularly practice tech & behavioral questions). Also deployed one of my Springboard projects as a Flask web app. I went to events/Meetups, did informational phone calls w/ close and distant contacts, and applied to several jobs (requiring cover letters) each week. 

Overall: Good self-paced curriculum that covers the basics. Pricey, YMMV, but worth it for me ultimately. I found a job 2 months after completing the bootcamp, but a lot of the post-bootcamp work was on me to apply, network, etc. Happy with my mentor and interactions with staff.",11/8/2018,Data Science Career Track,3.7,[],4.0,4.0,3.0,springboard

Pros:
- My mentor, Sarah, was amazing. Her background in UX was mind blowing and gave great inputs on my projects and great advice on everything. 
- The Capstone project was really cool to do, it pretty much built my portfolio and the mentor helps you along every step of the way.
- The smaller assignments were great tools to learn about UX design and it really helps grasp some concepts.
- You can work at your pace, finish quicker if you wanted, or finish at a later date than expected.

Cons:
- I don't think the course material is all that great. It's just articles and videos online curated by the staff and I honestly didn't feel I was ""learning"" much from them.
- The course I took was online, so if you don't put in time and work, you won't get anywhere and waste $$.

Overall:
I think with the Springboard UX Design course, you get what you put in. If you are determined to build a great portfolio and get things done on your own, this will help you grasp the concepts and push something out so you can interview. If you need someone to babysit you and teach you things page by page, this is not for you. Don't take this course expecting them to set you up with a job or anything.

I learned everything I needed to know to build a solid foundation to help me continue to learn and ask the right questions. My one on one mentor was the best mentor I've ever had!

244951,2018.0,True,Springboard UX Design Course,"I honestly can't speak highly enough about Springboard. I feel like I received an amazing value for the cost of the course. The course is self-paced, and you can complete it as quickly or as slowly as you like. I finished the course in about 2 months, which I've heard is pretty quickly — I had just graduated from college when I started the course though and was only working part time. I imagine someone with less time on their hands might take between 4 and 6 months. You're also paired with a mentor, whom you meet with once a week for 30 minutes to discuss any projects you've turned in and any questions you have about the curriculum. These sessions are hands down the best part about the course; anyone can just find a variety of content about UX online and teach themself how to design, but the mentor helps validate a lot of that learning and encourages you as you go. 

The content of the course is an amalgamation of various sources online about UX design, from Lynda courses to Skillshare to articles on Medium and other sites. The quality of the materials tends to be great, though there are a few pieces that I skipped over. You only need to complete 60% of the course and all 13 projects in order to receive your certificate, so if you already feel well versed in an area then you can cut straight to the area's project and move on. 

I'm excited for more of Springboard's in-person events, too! As of this review, they have hosted one conference/meet-up at their headquarters in San Francisco earlier in September, and meeting with other students, staff, an faculty really cemented for me that I chose the right course.

If you work at a company that is going to hire data scientists or if you need to be able to work with and understand data scientists, the intro class is for you. It gets into the weeds of data science just enough to not scare you away but enough to give you the ability to understand what data scientists do.

If you want to pursue data science as a career, the intro class gives you a basic understanding of R and R studio and gets into the meat of data science enough to help you decide on if data science is the career for you. You also can apply the first 2 months of the course tuition to the data science career track if you decide to pursue further education.

You also have a mentor you can email and talk with via skype once a week. This is an invaluable service and really allows springboard to stand apart from the other schools.

The most important part is all the topics had their own project submissions which enabled you to understand the topic and complete the project based on your learning.

The content and mentor calls do a fantastic job of introducing and reinforcing concepts with hands-on project work that ultimately builds into a polished portfolio case study.

Content

One of the things I like most about Springboard is that the content is [mostly] non-proprietary. The course is essentially a curation of the internet's best free and paid resources on UX design, which makes the course very accessible and true to the lean UX concept. Why remake already great content? 

At some points the content does seem to be a bit overkill (I think there were ~6 different resources on building paper prototypes) but overall it was well-rounded and very helpful.

Mentors

If I'm being honest, having a mentor is the biggest factor in me completing the course. Had it not been for my weekly meetings with Andre it would have been far more difficult to find the motivation to complete. Every week we had insightful discussions about my submissions, and more generally about the UX process.

Having the opportunity to have dedicated conversations with my mentor about data science concepts, my coursework, and some tangential learning set my experience apart from some of the other online courses I have taken.  

The effort of the support and career services staff were equally essential to help bring the course together.

You can buy UX books or read about UX online, but the mentorship that comes along with Springboard’s program is invaluable. My mentor had many years of UX experience and was always thoughtful and prepared to give feedback on my projects—his support throughout the program made the course worth the money. I loved that the course also offered “office hours” each week that featured a different topic centered around User Experience design, such as “careers” or “freelance,” where you could ask questions with experienced professionals.

My favorite part about Springboard is the connection with my mentor.   My mentor helped me tremendously with my capstone projects and gave me great advice in the workplace. The one thing that I had hoped for from Springboard is referrals. It is very difficult to build connections in a short period of time and then ask for referrals when applying for jobs. Hearing back from companies after applying and reaching out via Linkedin has been a struggle for me.  It would be nice to receive a little more help in the job search.  I am still looking for a job.

I'm pretty self-motivated, which you'll need as the course is self-paced (you can also choose to pay per month which is an extra motivation to complete the course as fast as you can!), but wanted some sort of defined path to teach myself data science.  There are a ton of online resources for free but it's pretty much impossible to know where to start without guidance.

The course does a great job of starting you from basics but they move you on pretty quick from there in case you already have a foundation in CS or statistics.  They match you with a mentor who can give feedback on your projects or answer any questions you might have about the material or the industry.  

The job guarantee is a big reason why I chose this course.  It was pretty much a win-win.

239923,2017.0,True,Springboard DSC: An amazing place to start your journey with Data Science,"I was a student of Springboard's Data Science Career Track between July and November 2017. Completing the track has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. The track was extremely streamlined and sufficiently challenging to keep you involved for the entire duration.
The biggest take away of the program was the mentorship. My mentor, Baran, taught me skills that you will never find in a book or a publicly offered MOOC. He also gave me invaluable glimpses into the world of professional data science. With his constant guidance, I was able to participate in Data Science Hackathons, publish and gather traction for my kernels on Kaggle and  develop a proposal for a talk on Inferential Statistics which was accepted in SciPy India 2017.
Another huge benefit of the program is the network you get to build. Springboard mentors and alumni work at amazing places. I connected and interacted with more than a dozen people doing inspiring work. My mentor personally introduced me to Data Scientists at Airbnb (my first capstone project was on Airbnb User Bookings) and Amazon.  They, in turn, gave me a sneak peak of their work at their respective companies.
As part of DSC, I completed over 15 technical projects and 2 major Capstone Projects. With the help of my mentor, I was able to channel my work in the right places. My analysis on TED Talks caught the eye of the Kaggle CEO who then submitted my notebook to the official TED Team. My second capstone project on Movie Recommender Systems had me publishing a dataset that was trending at the top for 3 straight days. 
The material I learnt from Springboard also helped me in performing reasonably well in Data Science Competitions. My bachelors' thesis project on Fake News Detection is also based on the knowledge I acquired from the program. 
Finally, DSC prepares you for the non technical aspects of getting a job. There are intensive, personal evaluations of your LinkedIn Profile, your resume and mock interviews. These exercises prepare you well for evaluating, applying and eventually interviewing for various data science jobs.
All in all, DSC is a great investment if you want to switch careers or get started with the field of Data Science. It prepares you for entry level Data Science jobs and equips you with enough expertise to jump into more advanced material after the program.

The team that runs Springboard is very attentive and quick to help.  For being an online community, they truly make it an inclusive experience. Springboard is a program designed for self-starters and self-paced.  You pay month to month, and if you work full time, like I was  you can expect this to take 3-5 months time frame, which I think is a perfect time frame to really get the most out of the course and also time with your mentor.  Sandy (my mentor) was an amazing asset!! She works full time as a UX designer and had a graphic design background.  I appreciated her feedback and direction throughout the entire course.

244835,2017.0,True,Springboard - Foundations in Data Science,"I took the Foundations in Data Science course from Springboard. I have had some introduction to statistics and programming (quite a bit of stats in my MBA program and took many datacamp certificates for R and Python programming).

Really enjoyed the foundations course from Springboard. Have tried using many MOOC`s (massive online open courseware) to learn data science but to no use. Springboard`s mentor driven and community driven coursework is a lot better. Setting up the R Studio environment, Github, writing code on R, R markdown etc, all take quite some effort, if you are from a non computer science background (I am not a CS major but had some coding in high school and undergrad). This is where the mentor and community are most useful. 

The $ 500 per month fee is very reasonable for the community, mentor interactions and curriculum that you get in the course. 

My advice to prospective students who have no background in statistics and programming is as follows:

1) First learn statistics from online resources like Khan Academy, Saylor.org etc. Topics may include descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, types of distributions, probability), inferential statistics (p-value, Z-scores, hypothesis test, t-test) and machine learning (linear regression, logistic regression, some simple classification algorithms etc). Even datacamp.com has many good coding courses built around statistics.    

2) Learn some R, Python and SQL from datacamp.com. Take a total of 10 certificate courses from datacamp in these 3 programming languages. This will really help develop your coding skills. In R, take introduction to R, intermediate R, dplyr, ggplot, statistics with R etc. In Python, learn numpy, pandas, seaborn etc. 

3) After you have finished above 2 points, you can move to Springboard. You may think that Springboard is also about the first 2 points. Yes, it is. But the most important part of Springboard is the capstone project. Once you have completed point 1 and 2, you can enter the Springboard foundations course confidently and spend most of your time thinking and working on your capstone project. Remember that nothing matches the skills you develop while completing an end to end capstone project. This is only possible on Springboard at a very reasonable price.

Lots of effort and motivation + Springboard + Datacamp is the best formula for becoming a quantitative analyst/junior data scientist, if you do not already have a background in statistics and computer science.",9/14/2017,Introduction to Data Science,3.3,[],4.0,5.0,1.0,springboard

Mentor-led style of learning works best for someone who wants to enter this field and is by far he best way to learn everything about this dynamic field. The support-structure provided my Springboard, right from the student advisor to your mentor, is amazing and Springboard gives it's all for you to go out there and be successful. The perks of the slack community, career resources, office hours, capstone presentation as well as the electives offered in the curriculum make this certification totally worth it and makes it stand out from the rest. Finally, the mentors are some of the most passionate and the most knowledgeable people in the field of Data Science working for the biggest companies in the world, which provides you with an unique opportunity to network and learn from the best.",8/25/2017,Intermediate Data Science,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

237008,2017.0,True,Fulfilled all the practices I needed to succeed,"I've been a visual designer (mostly web) for about 10 years. I've done aspects of UX in many of my jobs/projects. But there were a lot of best practices in research and prep that I'd never properly learned to be an official UX designer. I learned and practiced all these textbook need-to-knows and quickly got my portfolio updated to prove it through this course in a matter of a few months. I saved $1000's from avoiding full-time courses that I didn't need since I had quite a lot of on the job training already. Since completing the course I've gotten messages weekly to daily from recruiters on LinkedIn looking to place me in new exciting roles at big and small companies. TOTALLY WORTH IT.

237018,2017.0,True,UX Design Certification,"I took the Springboard UX course early in 2017 when I had gotten laid off unexpectedly. I had planned to take it, but it just gave me a bit more time to focus on the course and since it was a pay by the month situation, I figured it was a really good time to dive in. The course itself is quite thorough in a lot of ways. I have a graphic design background, but you really don't need any background to go through it. Since I had read some books, did some reading online and took a few high-level UX courses, it was a bit easier at the start for me than maybe it would be for others. I enjoyed the set your own pace aspect and devoted 4-5 hours a day toward it, but it could easily be worked on part-time and be effective. I do think that the more immersed in the hands-on work you get, the better understanding you'll have. I found the projects and the mentor sessions to be arguably more valuable than some of the articles and videos you watch, but it's partially because I learn better by doing than observing. Overall, I really enjoyed the learning and came out of the course with a good portfolio piece as well as a solid understanding of how to do UX generally. I didn't utilize the job search assistance because I was able to get another graphic design job before I finished the course. I think if you go through the course you might be able to get an entry-level UX job if you did a solid job of thinking about your portfolio as you went through the course, otherwise, expect some work at the end to make your work presentable to prospective employers. I suggest Springboard for anyone who likes to get through a bootcamp fairly quickly and in the comfort of your own home.",7/30/2017,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,springboard

236952,2017.0,True,Gret experience with Springboard,"For me it was either springboard or GA. I chose Springboard because I was able to get it done for more than 10,000 cheeper. 
I feel the quality was just as good and it suited my learning style and especially pace cause I'm working another job. 

I live in a major metropolitan city so I can make all the connections I need by going to tech meetups and through friends so GA really didn't really sell me on the connection element.

And again, I don't feel that I had any less quality of an education and my mentor Fabio Muniz (whom I strongly recommend) was very insightful and just as good or probably better than anyone I could have worked with at GA or elsewhere. And with Springboard during your mentor calls you will have their full attention whereas in a class if there's something really specific you need to get after you can get the full undivided attention without worrying about slowing a class or other students down.

In this case I'm giving the job support a 5 star as it may be not the same as some of the others it's 5 stars for the value. And your mentor will be able to tell you everything you need to know about finding your first career in UX.

241588,2017.0,True,Excellent UX Design course,"I took Springboard's UX Design course, and really enjoyed my experience. The curriculum was engaging, varied enough to accommodate many different learning styles, and was dynamic - Springboard updates their curriculum all the time, so nothing feels out of date. The emphasis on working with other students through the online community made it easy to gather ongoing feedback about your process, and simulated a bit of what it's like to work on a UX team - you never work in a bubble ;) 

The self-paced nature of the class is a bit of a double-edged sword, because you can finish the course while working a full time job, but it does mean you need to be really self-motivated - I work full time, and finished the course in 3 months. Both your mentor and Springboard advisors are extremely helpful and supportive, and can even provide suggested timelines for what to work on each week in order to finish the course in the time that meets your needs.

As I mentioned earlier, each student is assigned a mentor, with whom you work closely, meeting each week to discuss progress, goals, and other, non-course-related aspects of UX design work. This mentor/student relationship was invaluable to my success. My mentor is extremely talented and charismatic and working with her helped keep me on track.

I had worked in UX for about a year but didn't have any personal examples that I could show for on my public portfolio. My Springboard (Sara) was extremely helpful in providing me with feedback and recommending resources that were outside of what the course had listed. 

This course was great because as a freelance web designer, my schedule isn't consistent week to week. Since the course is flexible, you are able to do as much or as little of the work each week to make it work for you. 

I was left with an amazing portfolio piece on the entire process of UX Design and have been offered multiple positions since completing the course. I also felt extremely comfortable in the interviews as I was confidently able to walk through the ENTIRE UX Design process since I had gone through every piece.

I felt very catered to with a flexible schedule, practical projects, and a thorough curriculum it was extremely fun to learn.

Also, I have been able to apply some of the tools and techniques I learned to my job. Though I joined thr workshop with the intent to understand and apply data analytics techniques to my current job, going thru this workshop also helped me think how I can use my passion for data to make a career switch.

Two aspects of the workshop I liked best:

1. The course content focused on real-life examples, skills, and practices supported by excellent feedback from my mentor.

2. My mentor was very knowledgeable and was able to give me not only feedback on my assignments but also pointers to additional information and reading materials that he knew would be applicable to my job.",7/23/2017,,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,,springboard

243550,2017.0,True,Foundations of Data Science Review,"I recently completed the  Foundations of Data Science course. It took me a little less than 3 months to complete the curriculum and  capstone project. 

The best part about Springboard is the mentoring. I loved my mentor--she was extremely generous with her time and knowledge and her interests and mine aligned very well. She was always quick to respond and really encouraged me to push forward with coding and analytics that I felt usure about. I really miss my mentor!

I came to Springboard with no coding background , but with a graduate degree and some knowledge of statistics. Springboard does not make ANY of their own curriculum and they don't craft any tie-ins or connections between the different lessons. A large part of the curriculum is based off of Data Camp to learn R. Learning through Data Camp has it's own set of challenges and none of these are addressed by Springboard. Other components of the course include the EdX Analytics series and dplyr videos through Data School. Many of these resources are good on their own, but none is complete enough to give the student (or at least one w/o a coding background) sufficient foundation to tackle the assignments. Often the assignments are so disconnected from the curriculum, that they are difficult to complete w/o help for your mentor--which is OK to a degree, but given that each mentor session is 30 minutes--often time runs out before addressing the capstone and other project concerns. I really feel that more attention should be paid to the curriculum---it is certainly OK to use resources from other sites, but there should be reinforcement of key concepts like..writing functions...through either supplemental videos created by Springboard, or focus lessons during the office hours.

With regard to job assistance--there is none and the career materials provided, again are brief You Tube video clips or books that are not presented in any kind of way to give the student a view of the field, options for careers or even guidance in terms of moving forward with skills, once one completes the course. In fact, after completing the course, there is zero follow up or transition. I never received any certificate or any kind of ""next steps  if you want to keep learning"" email. Once I finished and got my rubric from my mentor (and stopped paying the monthly fee), Springboard went off the radar.",5/16/2017,Introduction to Data Science,1.7,[],3.0,1.0,1.0,springboard

I spoke to people who were data scientists and they stressed about the positive effect a constant mentor can have in such a phase. Springboard understands this very well and tackles it in the best possible way by roping in industry experts who become your extremely helpful mentors (who else could teach you better?!). 

An extremely flexible schedule, a thorough curriculum which makes on understand every concept from the ground up, super fun mentors and a great community - everything that one needs to begin a career in Data Science is right there.

235476,2016.0,True,I highly recommend it!,"Compared to other online data science training programs, the best part of the SpringBoard is the mentor system in which they assigned a prominent Data Scientist working in the industry as your mentor. Using google search, everyone can easily find thousands of websites for the data science courses. However, for the people without data science background, like me, it is very hard to know what kind of knowledge and skills for the data science in the real world. This training equipped with both theoretical and practical skills to solve industry problems. With the mentor system, I was assigned a mentor to learn first hand how to think like and solve problems like a data scientist. At the end of the training, I finished a project to solve a data science issue in the real world. The feedback from the expert is extremely important for those people want to find a data science job but have no experience on that. The only one thing to complain is my mentor knows too much, it is hard for me to digest all of them in a short time. Except for the mentor system, I also enjoyed the data science community. In the community, you can post questions or share the experience with others.

During my research I came across Springboard which was offering a course of training that covered all the same topics as the university programs with better cost and schedule, and complete with access to a data science mentor currently working in the industry.

Having completed the program in early 2017, I feel I came out with a solid technical foundation in data science techniques and tools. On top of that, the practical advice from my awesome mentors was highly valuable with insights into day to day responsibilities and expectations.

I would much rather do this in a stress-free and at-your-own-pace environment than a degree program: it minimizes the monetary risk and you can focus on the material that is most relevant to the work you do.

As a student in software engineering... Sticking with the discipline and the kind of learning I went through, it didn't give me a wider range of knowledge i wished to seek.
There was no design or human interaction involved out of school. There was no vibe of control over the things you want to do. Everything was structured and it just wasn't my taste.
So, I decided to take UX Design in hope that it would play along side with my Engineering/Programming background and build a more diverse portfolio.

In the workshop, I finished it in 3 months. Depending on how much time you want to put in it, how fast you want to complete it is all up to you. Obviously the more effort you put into the workshop the more you get out of it. It was very flexible to my time but also intimidating to the point where you're not making use of all your money if you decide to miss a week or even 2 weeks. I honestly could've finished it faster if i put my full focus into the workshop. And that's the point of this program, you work at your own pace and you figure out when you can subsidize it with your daily routine.

I've learned quite a big chunk of stuff and used it to my advantage for my school courses(depends) as well as outside business work.

You're assigned a personal mentor to meet with once each week and guide you through the program.  This is probably the best aspect of the program, since you are assigned to work with someone who is at the top of the UX Design field and lives and breathes this subject on a daily basis.  It's not a case of a professor who hasn't been in the real world for several years.  You're meeting with someone who is leading the way in this field.  My personal mentor, Julia DeBari, was fantastic.  

The biggest thing to keep in mind is that what you get out of this program is based on how much work and effort you put into it.  It can be easy to fall behind on course work, but if you do that you're only hurting yourself and your progress.

Well, I finally got my chance after being laid off from my previous employer and knew I had to do something to get into a different field. I had looked at another 3 month intensive course in NYC, but that would have taken me away from my family and also costed much more (about $9k and not including rent). So I figured I'd give Springboard a try. They have a free course that includes videos from online that is curated by seasoned UX Designer. The paid version, you get a mentor paired with you for 30 min weekly calls and also to ask questions and review your projects. They have many mentors from different backgrounds and from different geographical locations. I personally wanted someone who had a print background to help me transition, and a friend of mine who is from Brazil actually got a Brazilian mentor which was a huge help for her. Well, after completing the course, I began applying for UX jobs, and got an opportunity to interview with a eCommerce business for a junior position. Quite honestly, I felt well prepared for the interview and got advice from my mentor and other mentors throughout the process. I have now been at my current position for the past 10 months, and I know I have made the right decision. Thank you Springboard!",12/15/2016,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard

242681,2016.0,True,A way to stay current for the highly motivated!,"This was my first online experience and it didn't disappoint. I was motivated to complete the program so I made sure I was ready for my meeting with my mentor every week. My mentor was  extremely knowledgeable and always ready with information and links to help guide me through the UX and UI processes of working on my very first mobile app. He kept me motivated and always thinking about how to take my project to the next level. The program can be paced for your individual comfort, but for me, I found the discipline of my weekly mentor meeting motivating enough to finish in 8 weeks.  I am very happy that I took this class with Springboard. I'm super proud that I accomplished my goal of staying current with the technology and methodology of my field.",12/12/2016,UX Design,5.0,[],5.0,5.0,5.0,springboard
234178,2016.0,True,Springboard is an excellent course for self driven learners,"I really enjoyed my time with the Springboard UX Design Workshop. The course lets you learn at your own pace, but alleviates the problem of most online courses: isolation. 

Interacting with a professional mentor each week allows the student to really get a 'boots on the ground' perspective of the course. It also allows a student to ask questions and bridge the gap between knowledge gathering and practical application.

By the end of the course, I had completed a rewarding portfolio project and I was surprised at how much I was able to accomplish with the course.

I thoroughly recommend the course.",12/10/2016,UX Design,4.7,[],5.0,5.0,4.0,springboard
